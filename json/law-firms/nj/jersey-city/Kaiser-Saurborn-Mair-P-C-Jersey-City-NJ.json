    "description": "<p>Founded in 1997, Kaiser Saurborn &amp; Mair, P.C. is widely recognized for the quality of its representation and its use of uncompromising and rigorous advocacy and dynamic legal strategies to achieve its clients' goals. We have a proven track record of successfully designing and implementing litigation strategies that are individually tailored to serve the needs and objectives of our clients.</p><p>The Firm devotes its practice to employment law and complex and high-stakes litigation. The Firm's individual clients include executives, professionals, employees and partners at some of the nation's leading businesses, financial institutions, academic institutions, hospitals, law firms and accounting firms. The Firm also counsels and represents a wide range of businesses, including professional firms, technology companies, developers and owners of real estate and other business clients, in litigation and other business disputes.</p><p>Our partners work directly in a one-on-one relationship with our clients to ensure that each receives high-quality, responsive and cost-effective representation designed to achieve the most successful outcome. We believe that first-class representation is rarely achieved by the \"layering\" of senior, mid-level and junior lawyers that is the hallmark of large-firm client representation. Both the cost-effectiveness and quality of our representation is enhanced by having our partners personally handle a client's case from beginning to end, not merely supervise the work performed by more junior lawyers. Clients select a law firm because of the depth of experience and qualifications of its partners, and we believe that those partners should handle each case directly in a \"hands-on\" manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
