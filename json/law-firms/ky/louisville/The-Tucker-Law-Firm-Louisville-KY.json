    "description": "<p>A minor injury accident can cause trauma, but when a car or truck crash, dog bite or surgical error results in severe harm, the damage can be life-changing. In Kentucky, The Tucker Law Firm offers an attentive and compassionate environment in which clients can share their stories. We then assess their circumstances, determine their options and advise them on what courses of action are most likely to meet their goals.</p><p>Transportation Accidents</p><p>Moving vehicles can be particularly dangerous, especially large commercial and mass transit vehicles such as tractor-trailers and buses. Trains and airplanes can also create devastating accidents. The causes are not always straightforward, though. We investigate accidents from all angles to identify whether negligence, vehicle defects or other conditions contributed so that we can pursue maximum damages for our clients.</p><p>Medical Mistakes</p><p>When people seek treatment, they should be able to trust medical professionals to provide the proper level of care. Providers, nurses and pharmacists are human and sometimes make avoidable mistakes, but they owe it to the people they harm to make reparation.</p><p>Property And Product Hazards</p><p>We help people who have sustained injuries in incidents such as slips, trips and falls; animal attacks; and other accidents due to hazardous property conditions. Our law firm also accepts cases involving faulty products, dangerous drugs and defective medical devices.</p><p>Willful Harm</p><p>The Tucker Law Firm provides aggressive representation on behalf of the victims of assault and battery as well as nursing home residents who have suffered abuse. We are not afraid to fight insurance companies that act in bad faith and refuse to honor their obligations. In every case, we seek justice for our clients. We provide a free telephone consultations and virtual appointment options.</p>"
