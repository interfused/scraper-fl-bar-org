    "description": "<p>There are no two personal injury cases alike in Decatur, Illinois. At The Law Offices of Frederick W. Nessler and Associates, Ltd., we know that your situation is unique from our other clients, and we believe in customizing every strategy we put together and in working with you personally to determine what the best approach for your case is. For example, some people who have suffered an incident such as clergy abuse or nursing home neglect prefer to reach a settlement. In other cases such as medical malpractice or a drunk driving accident, it may be best to go to trial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Further, your case is different because of the circumstances involved. To prove your claim, the team at our law offices take every measure necessary. We speak with medical experts, witnesses, law enforcement officers and anyone else whose testimony may be useful. In a workers’ compensation claim, we are able to cite studies about asbestos exposure or demonstrate how your injury is keeping you from making a living. Each of these steps is crucial in proving how your loss occurred, and who should compensate you for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our attorneys at The Law Offices of Frederick W. Nessler and Associates, Ltd., have spent decades working through wrongful death claims, negotiating with insurance companies due to an uninsured driver and illustrating how a product endangered a consumer. We take those experiences and apply them to your case in Chicago, Champaign, Rockford or Springfield. For your convenience, we offer free initial consultation.</p>"
