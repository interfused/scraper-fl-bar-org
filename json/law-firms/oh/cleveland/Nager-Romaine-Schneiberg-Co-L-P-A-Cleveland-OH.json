We specialize in workers' compensation, personal injury, automobile accidents, wrongful death, medical malpractice and Social Security Disability cases.</p><p align=\"center\"><strong><font size=\"3\">Got Hurt? Get Results. Get NR&amp;S!</font></strong></p><p>With more than 150 years of combined legal experience, the attorneys of our law firm help individuals obtain fair compensation in cases against insurance companies, the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, the Social Security Administration, negligent doctors, negligent motorists, trucking companies and others. We regularly deal with complex litigation, difficult insurance claims adjusters and governmental agencies to resolve every aspect of your claim in a manner that is most beneficial to you. </p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Workers' Compensation</strong></p><p>When an injury happens on the job, it can be a very stressful time for a family or individual. There are concerns about getting medical care, who will pay for medical care, will the injured worker continue to be paid while recovering from his/her injuries, will their job be protected, etc. With a staff of 12 attorneys and over 20 paralegals, we fight for injured workers to get the benefits they are owed and we assist each client and family in dealing with the pressures caused by injuries on the job. We take the guesswork out of this complicated system and try to restore comfort and control to our client's lives. Each of the lawyers at NR&amp;S understands the intricacies of Ohio workers' compensation laws and we work relentlessly on your behalf to obtain compensation for lost wages, medical expenses, therapy, surgery, retraining, and psychological injuries all while helping to protect your job and navigating a complicated system with one goal in mind - serving the client. We fight hundreds of hearings weekly at the Industrial Commission of Ohio, in every corner of the state, and we fight every case tirelessly through the appeals process.</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Automobile Accidents / Personal Injury</strong></p><p>Automobile accidents are the most common type of claims commonly referred to as \"personal injury\" or PI claims. At NR&amp;S we handle all types of personal injury claims and we have a department of dedicated and experienced attorneys and paralegals focused solely on these cases. When injuries happen, and it's someone else's fault, the injured person usually finds himself/herself stuck in middle dealing with auto insurance adjusters, medical billing providers, health insurers and the at fault party who are all looking out for themselves. We fight to put you on the top in that fight so that the insurance companies don't add insult to your injury.</p><p>Our firm has handled tens of thousands of personal injury cases caused by the negligent operation or maintenance of automobiles, motorcycles, ATVs, trains, homes, businesses, machines, medical devices and hospitals. There likely isn't a type of personal injury claim that we haven't handled. Each claim is unique and every case requires careful analysis and game planning to maximize the recovery of the client. Our personal injury and auto accident lawyers have the skill and drive to get exceptional results. If you find yourself in need of representation on any kind of personal injury case, contact us to set up a no strings attached meeting where we can develop a strategy to help you through this difficult time.</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Social Security Disability</strong></p><p>If you are disabled and unable to work, we can help. Our disability attorneys help clients nationwide apply for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits and deal with the Social Security Administration (SSA). We can help you navigate the claim process, making sure all the critical documentation is provided and in order. If your claim for Social Security disability is denied, let a Social Security Disability lawyer at NR&amp;S champion your appeal.</p><p>Do not hesitate to contact us at 800-743-2797 for a free initial consultation with a skilled attorney.</p>"
