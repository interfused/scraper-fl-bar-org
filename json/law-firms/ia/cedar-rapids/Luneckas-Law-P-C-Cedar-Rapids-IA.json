    "description": "<p>At the law firm of Luneckas Law, P.C., we handle matters of personal injury for clients in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Our experiences extend to injuries such as animal bites, wrongful deaths, workers' compensation, trucking accidents, Social Security Disability, railroad worker injuries, products liability, premises liability, medical malpractice, car accidents, mass transit and aviation accidents, assault and battery, brain injury, birth injury and asbestos mesothelioma. </p><p>The attorney at our law firm has more than two decades of experience working with attorneys and insurance companies to obtain fair settlements for the injured. With an Avvo \"Superb\" rating and as one of the Top Ten Attorney for Personal Injury named by the National Association of Personal Injury Attorneys, we are fully prepared to handle any case that comes our way.</p><p>Although we do accept credit cards for payment, we also offer a contingency fee payment so that our clients are not required to pay until they receive their settlement or judgment. We believe this allows those who are injured, who may not have the cash or assets to hire an attorney to still get what they deserve from the entity that caused the injury or illness without worry about finances.</p><p>We focus on efficiency and work tirelessly to develop a unique strategy for each individual case at the law firm of Luneckas Law, P.C. Accidents and injuries caused by another can lead to years of suffering and pain that was undeserved. Our goal is to protect the best interests of our clients, so they can recover fully without worrying about paying for their care.</p><!--[if !mso]><style> v\\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} o\\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} w\\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} .shape {behavior:url(#default#VML);} </style><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal 0 false false false false EN-US ZH-CN X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]><style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; line-height:107%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style><![endif]-->"
