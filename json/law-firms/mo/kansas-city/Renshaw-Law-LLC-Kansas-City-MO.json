    "description": "<p>No doubt, you want to be represented by an attorney who will do the best for you and your case. Unfortunately, you probably won't know who that attorney is from a nice photo or a slick website. Call my firm. When you do, <strong>you'll speak directly to me</strong>--not some associate attorney or paralegal. And you'll speak to me every time because I work on every case at Renshaw Law.</p><p>In more than a decade as a plaintiff's attorney, I have represented injured people in Missouri, Kansas, and at least a dozen other states. I strive to provide the highest level of representation to each and every client and will do the same for you if you give Renshaw Law the opportunity.<br>I have worked on nearly every kind of plaintiff case possible from auto-wrecks to the most complicated business fraud or medical malpractice. I have represented hundreds of clients across the country for mass torts such as trans-vaginal mesh, pharmaceuticals, and rice contamination. I encourage you to contact Renshaw law soon. There is too much at stake, and likely, an insurance company has already begun working against your interests.</p><p><strong>The Practice Areas I Cover</strong></p><p>Personal injury is a much wider field than many people realize. While car crashes do make up a big part of my caseload, it is certainly not all I do. I also handle cases involving:</p><blockquote style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px\"><p></p><ul><li>Personal injury of every kind</li><li>Auto accidents</li><li>Brain injuries/head trauma</li><li>Falls</li><li>Trucking accidents</li><li>Medical malpractice</li><li>Defective medical devices</li><li>Business torts and toxic torts</li><li>Pharmaceuticals</li></ul><p></p></blockquote><p><strong>My Process At Renshaw Law, LLC</strong></p><p></p>When you choose Renshaw Law to represent you, you can be confident that I will work on your case, rather than just being the name for the firm. When you choose Renshaw Law as your legal representation, you get me on your case, every time. I can say this because I'm old enough to know what needs to be done and young enough to carry out the hard work myself.<p></p>"
