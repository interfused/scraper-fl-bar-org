    "description": "<p>At Stiver Law, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we are aggressive in pursuing compensation for our clients who have been injured through negligence or an on-the-job accident. However, to our clients, we are approachable, providing a caring environment at our law office where we can listen to their story and their goals. Once we begin developing a strategy, we stay in close contact, providing updates as they become available, so clients never have to wonder what is happening.</p><p>Our law office practice areas include dental and medical malpractice. These types of cases are characterized by a harmful mistake made by a licensed medical professional who did not adhere to a standard of reasonable care. Medical professionals, along with facilities such as clinics and hospitals, carry liability insurance to cover the costs if they make mistakes. Our goal is to obtain the settlement or verdict that covers all of the damages a client suffers, including noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering and lost quality of life.</p> We also handle bad faith insurance cases, as well as premises liability, slip-and-fall accidents, car and trucking accidents and dog bites. When people die as a result of someone else's negligence, our law office represents family members in holding the responsible parties liable for the wrongful death. The initial consultation at Stiver Law is free.<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal 0 false false false EN-IN X-NONE X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]><style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; mso-para-margin-top:0cm; mso-para-margin-right:0cm; mso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; mso-para-margin-left:0cm; line-height:107%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style><![endif]-->"
