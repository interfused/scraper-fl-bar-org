    "description": "<p>WilliamsFord is proud to provide staunch, experienced advocacy during personal injury cases. Our law office in Winchester, Virginia - together with our sister location in Leesburg - provides service to clients in West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland.</p><p>Insurance companies, commercial trucking companies, healthcare providers and other powerful organizations often do everything within their ability to minimize the value of personal injury claims. To face this, we prepare our cases to win from the very beginning. Then, we tenaciously pursue the level of compensation that will allow our clients to put their lives back together.</p><p>Many injured people have never been part of a personal injury case before. Our law office, on the other hand, has recovered hundreds of thousands of dollars for many of our clients. We have the experience necessary to handle all the complex, confusing details and negotiate cases to attain the best possible resolutions. </p><p>The last thing most people want to do is talk to a lawyer when they are injured or when they have recently lost a family member. We understand us, and we try to make our law office a caring, comfortable environment for people who are suffering.</p><p>Finally, we believe that everyone should have access to quality legal services, even if an accident is putting pressure on their finances. WilliamsFord offers flexible payment plans, including credit card payments. We also provide free consultations and virtual appointments.</p>"
