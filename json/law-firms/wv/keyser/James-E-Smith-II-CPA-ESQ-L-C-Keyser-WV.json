    "description": "<p><strong>Licensed In West Virginia And Maryland<br> James E. Smith II, CPA, ESQ L.C.</strong><br><br> My law practice is devoted to helping people with urgent and personal legal matters. For 31 years I have guided clients through personal bankruptcy (Chapter 7) to obtain a fresh financial start, through the difficulties of divorce and custody, and to favorable recoveries in personal injury accidents. </p><p>My background as a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) helps me address the tax and financial considerations of bankruptcy and other personal legal matters in a way that most attorneys cannot. I am always prepared to go to court to protect your interests, but I problem-solve issues from all angles to try to avoid the stress, expense and uncertainty of unnecessary litigation.</p><p><strong>A Local Attorney For All Your Legal Needs</strong><br> I was raised in this area and earned my law degree at the West Virginia University College of Law. I returned to Keyser in 1991 and opened my own law practice. I serve clients in Mineral County and surrounding counties of West Virginia, as well as residents of neighboring communities in Maryland. I invite you to come to me with any legal matter, including bankruptcy, family law, an auto accident, criminal charges, estate and tax planning, probate administration or general civil litigation. My legal knowledge and experience in the local courts works to your advantage as we work together to achieve the best result.</p><p>You need to be able to trust that your lawyer will listen to you and watch out for your interests. Contact the Keyser law firm of James E. Smith II, CPA, ESQ L.C., for one-on-one attention, individualized solutions and aggressive representation.</p><p><em>We are a debt relief agency. We help people file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code.</em></p>"
