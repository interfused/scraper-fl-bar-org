    "description": "<p>Some law firms lead and others follow. Since 1992, Levin &amp; Perconti has obtained more than $660 million in verdicts and settlements for individuals and families in all types of catastrophic personal injury, wrongful death, medical malpractice and nursing home matters. </p><p>Levin &amp; Perconti was one of the first firms to represent victims of nursing home neglect and abuse in personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits. Our lawyers have achieved over $160 million in nursing home cases verdicts and settlements alone, and these actions have helped raise public awareness surrounding the ever-growing epidemic of substandard care in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Our nursing home attorneys stand by the belief that our seniors and younger people with disabilities living in long-term care facilities are entitled to dignity, respect and proper nursing care free from negligence or abuse. We strive to end common issues that arise due to negligence such as bed sores, injuries from nursing home falls, medication errors, malnutrition and dehydration.</p><p>Our lawyers are also known for their work on behalf of victims of medical malpractice, bringing suit against healthcare providers who provide substandard care, resulting in birth injuries, surgical errors, wrong drugs, wrong dosages, medical device failure, and diagnostic errors. Complex malpractice cases require strong medical and legal knowledge and substantial resources. We are proud to provide these qualities and experience to each of our clients.</p><p>Additionally, we represent those seriously injured or killed in accidents caused by someone else's carelessness or negligence, including but not limited to: auto and truck accidents, defective products, slip-and-fall accidents and other catastrophic and wrongful death events.</p><p>Our firm believes that all victims of negligence should have access to our courts to ensure that they receive rightful compensation for the harms caused to them. Since our firm was founded, we have grown to employ 24 skilled Chicago lawyers and continue to fight for clients throughout the state of Illinois. If you have a question about a potential case, call our law firm for a free first consultation. We are happy to evaluate your claim and discuss your legal options with you over the phone or in person.</p><p></p>"
