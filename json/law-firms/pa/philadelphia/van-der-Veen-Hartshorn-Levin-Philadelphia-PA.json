    "description": "<p>At van der Veen, Hartshorn &amp; Levin, our attorneys provide aggressive and unwavering representation for victims of catastrophic accidents in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although we cannot take away the pain and trauma from injuries or the death of a loved one, we use our vast experience and legal knowledge to advocate for clients involved in car and motorcycle crashes, commercial vehicles and mass transit accidents, construction mishaps and slip and falls, product and premises liability cases, nursing home negligence, dog bite and dram shop scenarios. In one case, we were able to generate a $4.25 million jury verdict for a client injured in a trucking crash.</p><p>Additionally, our law office is there to defend people charged with crimes. We are equally skilled in handling misdemeanor offenses as we are in serious allegations such as child pornography, identity theft, aggravated assault and murder. Our attorneys are nonjudgmental and make it their mission to uphold a person’s right to a fair trial, no matter how complicated or severe the circumstances. In some cases, we are able to negotiate a complete dismissal of charges.</p><p>Beyond handling personal injury and criminal cases in Hunting Park, Pennsylvania, and the Philadelphia metropolitan area, we also offer counsel for civil rights and business matters, including contract disputes. When we are unable to resolve cases with agreeable settlements, our attorneys pursue matters vigorously in litigation. In a commitment to exceptional service, van der veen, O'Neill, Hartshorn, and Levin are pleased to offer a free initial consultation.</p>"
