    "description": "<p>Founding attorney Jerry Rhoads established the Madisonville law office of Rhoads &amp; Rhoads in 1974 in order to assist the residents of Owensboro and surrounding Western Kentucky who suffered injuries from negligence or on-the-job accidents. Today, over 40 years later, Mr. Rhoads and our law firm's six other experienced attorneys proudly help clients pursue compensation for personal injuries, Social Security Disability benefits and workers' compensation benefits.</p><p>When Mr. Rhoads founded our law firm, he did so with the knowledge of the struggles that people face after suffering debilitating injuries. He and his associates understand that personal injuries, workplace accidents and disabilities affect people not only physically, but also emotionally and financially. That is why he dedicated his practice to helping those people pursue the compensation or benefits that they need to continue to live happy, healthy and financially sound lives.</p><p>If you suffered injuries due to another person's negligent act or a workplace accident, the lawyers at Rhoads &amp; Rhoads can help you pursue compensation for your injuries. If you suffer from a disability due to an accident, toxic exposure or as the result of years doing the same job, we can assist you as you pursue Social Security Disability benefits. To find out more about the services we offer, you can schedule a free initial consultation.</p>"
