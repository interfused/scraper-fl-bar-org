    "description": "<p align=\"left\">Jeff Oliphant has spent his entire legal career working for victims of personal injury incidents and accidents. With an office centrally located in Indianapolis for the past 23 years, he has had the pleasure and opportunity to meet and represent clients throughout Indiana in a variety of matters that include:</p><div align=\"left\"><ul><li>Wrongful Death</li><li>Motor vehicle collisions</li><li>Premises liability</li><li>Commercial trucking collisions and incidents</li><li>Dog bites</li></ul></div><p align=\"left\">Jeff is a lifelong Indiana resident who will always be a Hoosier. He grew up in Southern Indiana and attended Indiana University where, as a student-athlete, he was able to balance the rigors of both the classroom and playing basketball for Coach Bob Knight. He attended law school, also at Indiana University, and quickly realized while working as a law clerk at a personal injury firm that he wanted to devote his time to helping people injured by the fault and negligence of others.</p><p align=\"left\">Jeff does not mass advertise with television commercials and billboards, choosing instead to have a more personal and attentive relationship with his clients. His understands their desire for him to be available when they call with a questions, and the importance of returning those calls as soon as he can when necessary.</p><p align=\"left\">Jeff Oliphant has been an admitted member of the Indiana State Bar Association and United States District Courts since 1995, is on the Indiana Trial Lawyers Board of Directors, and has been selected for inclusion in the Super Lawyers list in Indiana.</p>"
