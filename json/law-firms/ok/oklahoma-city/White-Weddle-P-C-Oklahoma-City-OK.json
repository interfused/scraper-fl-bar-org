Our motto: If it can be tried, we will take it on. We do not back down from any opponent. We frequently go to trial in personal injury cases, workers' compensation cases and insurance disputes, winning six-, seven- and eight-figure verdicts against big-name opponents like Farmers Insurance, Smith &amp; Nephew and Louisville Slugger.</p><p>When you choose White &amp; Weddle, P.C., not only will you have the confidence that comes with knowing that you have retained a trial law firm with a reputation for success, but you will also have the peace of mind that comes with knowing your case will be handled personally by one of our experienced lawyers. We consider individualized attention a must.</p><p>At our law firm, we are quite passionate about helping people whose lives have been devastated by the wrongs of others. That passion and commitment have been recognized in the form of our attorneys being listed in Super Lawyers and The Bar Register of Preeminent Lawyers, among other honors and awards.</p><p>Most people cannot afford $200-plus per hour for a lawyer. As contingent fee lawyers, we handle civil litigation without pay until justice is achieved. Only then do we get paid.</p>"
