Coming out of the military, I personally wanted an attorney that was straightforward and not tell me something that was unrealistic with my case. After my wife and I had issues with a previous attorney, he turned things around to represent us and never let us think that he was not fighting for us on our case. Mr. Padda will always be our attorney, whether for legal advise or representation.\" -Thomas (as posted on AVVO) </li><li> Paul Padda Law helped me a lot in my case. I got into an accident with my mom and she was at fault. But that didn’t stop them from trying their best to get me a good settlement. Every time they encountered a problem they would solve it right away and always had the best for me in mind. This is the second case that i have had with them and they always do a good job and never disappoint. I thank them very much for all the help and everything they have done for me. - Max (Posted on Google) </li></ul>"
