    "description": "<p>Lightening the burden placed upon those injured due to the negligence of others, we provide dedicated legal representation at San Diego Personal Injury Attorneys in California. Our law firm serves clients in the San Diego area, as well as in Carlsbad, Chula Vista, El Cajon, La Jolla, National City, Rancho Bernardo, San Marcos, Santee and Solana Beach, offering focused counsel and advocacy. To best serve our clients, we offer free initial consultations.</p><p>Having more than three decades of combined legal experience, our attorneys handle cases involving issues such as motor vehicle accidents, truck accidents, premises liability, medical malpractice, birth injuries, animal bites, asbestos and mesothelioma, assault and battery, sexual abuse, aviation and mass transit accidents, defective or dangerous drugs and medical devices, motor vehicle defects, product liability, workers' compensation and wrongful death.</p><p>Although they may act as though they are on the side of accident injury victims, insurance companies and large businesses often share the same goal in such cases - paying out as little as possible to those injured. Looking out for our clients' rights and best interests, we negotiate on their behalf, striving to help them hold those responsible for their injuries financially accountable. </p><p>Our team at San Diego Personal Injury Attorneys has recovered millions of dollars on behalf of people who have suffered injury through no fault of their own, including a $2.5 million settlement in a product defect case on behalf of a client who suffered a brain injury, a $2 million settlement for a client in a workplace accident claim and an award of $3 million on behalf of a client injured in a construction accident. We measure our success in helping each of our clients obtain maximum compensation for their injury-associated losses.</p>"
