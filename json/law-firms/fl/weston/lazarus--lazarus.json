    "description": "<p>At Lazarus &amp; Lazarus, our attorneys each bring more than 30 years of experience to the firm. They have dedicated their lives to helping people in Weston and other South Florida communities get justice when injured by someone else's negligence. Negligence can take many forms, and it can take some digging to discover who or what might have caused someone's suffering. Our attorneys know how to help.</p><p><strong>Personal injury practice areas at our law firm</strong></p><p>We handle a lot more than just traffic accidents and medical malpractice at our firm. We have experience in cases related to the following:</p><blockquote style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px\"><p>• Cruise ship accidents<br>• Amusement ride accidents<br>• Boating accidents<br>• Negligent or inadequate security<br>• Dog bites<br>• Pharmacy errors</p></blockquote><p>We may be able to build a case even if you are partially responsible for the incident that caused your injury. Our attorneys also take on some unconventional cases that clients have a hard time finding legal representation for elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Why choose Lazarus &amp; Lazarus</strong></p><p>Our attorneys focus on getting justice and compensation for our clients, so they can focus on recovering from their injuries. If the injured person has not survived their injuries, our work helps bring closure to bad situations and can help ensure that survivors have the resources necessary to care for minors and other dependents. It all begins with a free initial consultation at our Weston office or our main office in Fort Lauderdale. Our law firm treats all correspondences confidentially.</p>"
