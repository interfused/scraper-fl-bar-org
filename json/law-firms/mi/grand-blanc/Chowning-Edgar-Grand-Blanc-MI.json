    "description": "<p>At Chowning &amp; Edgar, we take pride in being a people-first law firm in Grand Blanc, Michigan. Our goal is to win our clients the money they need to recover from their injuries and resume their lives. So far, we have won our clients millions of dollars to support this goal. The attorneys at the law firm also bring decades of experience in workers' compensation to the table, so our clients can rest assured that they tap into a wealth of knowledge when they work with us.</p><p>Workers' compensation cases make up the bulk of the work we take on in Grand Blanc, Michigan. However, we also assist clients with defending their rights in many other types of cases. Some of these include personal injury, sexual abuse, defamation and privacy, Social Security and even wrongful death. Ideally, you never need our attorneys' services, but if you do, our wide area of experience allows us to take on even complex cases that span several practice areas.</p><p>Many people believe that if they already started working with a Grand Blanc attorney or began the process without one, we might refuse to work with them. We can step in to provide guidance at any step of the process, and people who get a head start might need it most of all. The good news is that the first discussion is absolutely free and comes with no obligation to work with our team.</p>"
