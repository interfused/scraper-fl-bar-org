    "description": "<p>With over 60 years of combined experience, the father and son team at Gama Law Firm represents victims of negligence throughout Colorado. Attorney Joe Gama is a former trial court judge so he brings a unique perspective to our cases. Our practice focuses on personal injury, which means all of our resources are poured into cases involving car and trucking accidents, slip and falls, medical malpractice, and dangerous drugs or products. <strong>Our consultations are free and there are never any upfront costs to get your case going. </strong></p><p>Unlike some larger firms in the Denver and Aurora area, we personally work on your case from beginning to end and we don't pass it off to some legal assistant or 'case manager.' And you communicate directly with attorneys Richard Gama or Joe Gama through the whole process.</p><p>For our successes at trial and in negotiating settlements, we have been recognized as top attorneys by Super Lawyers, The National Trial Lawyers Association, and American Institute of Trial Lawyers. We also take pride in having an A+ rating with the Colorado BBB. We look forward to serving you. </p>"
