    "description": "<p>When it comes to choosing a law firm to represent you in a medical malpractice case, experience counts. Medical malpractice claims are complex and should be brought by attorneys with the experience and resources required to get results.</p><p>Since 1988, the law firm of Abramson, Brown &amp; Dugan has represented people injured as a result of medical negligence in New Hampshire. During that time, our lawyers have recovered more than $275 million in verdicts and settlements for our clients. With offices in Manchester and Keene, we serve clients throughout New Hampshire. </p><p>Our firm focuses on serious injuries resulting from medical negligence or carelessness, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Birth injuries:</strong> We represent families devastated by birth injuries such as hypoxia, cerebral palsy, Erb's palsy and other impairments.</li><li><strong>Brain injuries:</strong> Brain injuries can result from labor and delivery errors, anesthesia errors, failure to diagnose a stroke or other medical negligence.</li><li><strong>Surgical errors:</strong> Surgical errors may include wrong-site surgery, operating on the wrong patient, failure to monitor a patient under anesthesia or other negligence.</li><li><strong>Misdiagnoses or failure to diagnose:</strong> Many diseases such as cancer and heart disease can be successfully treated as long as they are timely diagnosed. If a doctor fails to do so, the outcome can be far different.</li></ul><p>Our firm's partners, Mark Abramson and Kevin Dugan, have been consistently recognized in peer rankings as Best Lawyers, Super Lawyers, and NH's Top Attorneys. While we are proud of our awards and peer recognition, client satisfaction remains the most important measure of our success. Louise Brochu, a former client and Manchester resident noted, \"They were fabulous to me, very supportive. Mark and Eva were always there for me, they were just so responsive. I wasn't just a number or a case to them. They really cared about me and my situation. I'd definitely recommend them.\"</p><p>Call 603-463-0999 to schedule a free initial consultation to discuss your case with our medical malpractice lawyers.</p>"
