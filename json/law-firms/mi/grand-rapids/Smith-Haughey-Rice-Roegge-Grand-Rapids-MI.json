    "description": " Since 1941, Smith Haughey has called downtown Grand Rapids home. In 2011 we moved 53 attorneys and 54 professional staff into the 150-year-old Flat Iron Building. Our renovation of the building allowed us to reduce our environmental footprint, streamline our processes, and improve our flexibility and accessibility. All of which furthers our commitment to deliver exceptional efficiency to our clients right from the heart of Grand Rapids.<p>Notably, in the 2012 issue of Best Lawyers in America, the Grand Rapids office had more attorneys listed than any other law firm in the area in the following categories:</p><p> -Top-listed in Grand Rapids in legal malpractice law.<br> -Top-listed in Grand Rapids in medical malpractice law.<br> -Top-listed in Grand Rapids in personal injury litigation.</p><p></p>"
