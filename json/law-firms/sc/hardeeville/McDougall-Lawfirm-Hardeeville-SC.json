    "description": "<p>The McDougall Lawfirm provides dedicated personal injury representation to people and families in Beaufort, South Carolina, and throughout Allendale, Beaufort, Hampton and Jasper counties. Since our law firm was founded in 1996, we have committed ourselves to helping those injured by someone else's negligence or recklessness to obtain full and just compensation for their losses.</p><p>Due to injuries resulting from motor vehicle collisions, dangerous products or property conditions, or other types of accidents, people may experience a range of challenges beyond their physical pain and suffering. This includes suffering lost income while they are off work recovering and incurring unexpected medical bills. Advocating on their behalf from a free initial consultation until their cases are resolved, our No. 1 priority is helping our clients overcome the challenges resulting from their injuries.</p><p>Despite slogans that suggest otherwise, insurance companies often place an emphasis on their own bottom line following serious injury accidents as opposed to the needs of those who suffered harm. Undeterred by the prospect of going up against large insurance carriers or corporations, our attorneys aggressively pursue our clients' rights. Working to alleviate some of their stresses during an already difficult time, we stand by their side and offer them sound guidance through each stage of the legal process so they are prepared to make important decisions about their cases.</p><p>The McDougall Lawfirm has built a reputation of providing quality representation while maintaining high ethical standards, which has helped us build mutually beneficial working relationships with other area law firms. Often serving as co-counsel with other firms or accepting referrals, we tailor our strategies and involvement to serve our clients' best interests.</p>"
