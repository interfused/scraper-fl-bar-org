    "description": "<p><strong>Experienced And Renowned Personal Injury Attorneys </strong></p><p> Widely regarded as leaders in personal injury cases, Munley Law has locations in Scranton, Stroudsburg, Wilkes-Barre and Carbondale, Pennsylvania. For more than 50 years, our law firm has been recognized as the go-to practice for people who have suffered due to someone else’s negligence. The reason? Because we: </p><p> · Have recovered millions of dollars for our clients, </p><p> · Offer no-obligation, free consultations, </p><p> · Work collaboratively internally as well as with outside professionals, </p><p> · Rely on top experts to prove our claim, and </p><p> · Excel in both litigation and negotiation. </p><p> When it comes to customer service, our law firm is unmatched. Our team is motivated not by the awards we secure but from knowing that we are truly helping people in their time of need. However, we do operate on a contingency basis, which means we are only paid if our clients receive compensation. </p><p><strong>Highly Respected In Our Field</strong></p><p> Simply put, our results speak for themselves. Beyond the verdicts and settlements are the myriad honors the attorneys at our law firm have received. We have been listed in The Best Lawyers in America and The National Trial Lawyers: Top 100; we have been selected for inclusion in Super Lawyers list; and we have earned memberships in the Million Dollar Advocates Forum. Though the recognition is wonderful, we draw more satisfaction from getting our clients on the road to recovery. Munley Law accepts credit cards. </p>"
