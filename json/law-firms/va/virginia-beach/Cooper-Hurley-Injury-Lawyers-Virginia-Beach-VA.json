    "description": "<p>Cooper Hurley Injury Lawyers helps people hurt in auto, truck and motorcycle accidents, slip and falls and railroad accidents in Virginia Beach. We also help the families of wrongful death victims. The firm has a client meeting location in Pembroke Office Park close to Town Center. All cases are different and we cannot guarantee the same result in a given case, but we have recovered millions of dollars for clients and urge you to see the results page of our website. </p><p>Virginia Beach is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Every summer, thousands of people flock to the famous beach. Unfortunately, Virginia Beach sees many serious accidents involving deaths and injuries. The city regularly records more fatal accidents caused by drunk drivers than any other in the state. Every year, pedestrians and cyclists are injured and vacationers are hurt at hotels and in swimming pools.</p><p>After you have received medical attention for your immediate injuries, we are prepared to fight the at-fault party's insurance company and take the case all the way to trial if need be. Our lawyers have over 55 years of combined experience settling and litigating personal injury claims in the area. We are well acquainted with the accident and injury claims that Virginia Beach gives rise to, including:</p><p>• Car accidents<br>• Truck accidents<br>• Motorcycle accidents<br>• Accidents involving buses, pedestrians and bicycles<br>• Injuries at hotels, restaurants and stores<br>• Catastrophic injury (e.g., brain injuries and spinal cord injuries)<br>• Workplace injuries<br>• Railroad passenger accidents<br>• Railroad worker FELA claims<br>• Boating accidents<br>• Wrongful death<br>• Dog bites</p><p>Our attorneys have consistently been recognized for their excellence in personal injury law. Both our founders, John Cooper and Jim Hurley, are peer-rated AV Preeminent* by Martindale-Hubbell and have been selected for inclusion in Virginia Super Lawyers. Partner Bill O'Mara and attorney John Baker were selected by Super Lawyers to be Rising Stars, an accolade reserved for only 2.5 percent of lawyers in Virginia. Attorney Griffin O'Hanlon joined the firm in the fall of 2015, and Paige Thomas joined in 2018.</p><p>In addition to our awards and credentials, we have received many glowing testimonies and are proud to say that many of our clients are referrals from past clients. Unlike many of the big factory firms, we treat clients like family.</p><p>Schedule your free initial consultation with an attorney at Cooper Hurley Injury Lawyers by calling 757-905-4240.
