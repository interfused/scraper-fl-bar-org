    "description": "<p>At Gergely Law Offices in Schoolcraft, Michigan, we use our decades of experience and comprehensive knowledge of the law to counsel clients through complex personal injury and family law issues, toward favorable outcomes. Because of the unique and emotionally challenging nature of issues pertaining to personal injury, divorce, child custody, adoption and domestic violence and neglect, we work diligently to try to resolve clients' issues in the most timely, cost-effective and stress-free manner as possible. For many clients, this means resolving issues through mediation and negotiation, but for some, it may mean taking the case to trial, something our attorneys are more than prepared to do. Also, in injury cases, there is no attorney fee unless we win the case. </p><p>With four highly talented lawyers on our team, Gergely Law Offices has the resources to counsel clients in several areas of the law. Aside from family law, personal injury is another major focus of ours. We have helped individuals recover millions of dollars in trial verdicts and settlements for injuries arising from auto accidents, animal bites, medical malpractice and other injustices. Attorneys Michael C. Gergely and Mary Catherine Gergely also represent clients in matters pertaining to estate planning, probate and estate administration.</p><p>Mr. Gergely has over 50 years of trial experience. Over the past four decades, our law offices as a whole has helped thousands of clients obtain the outcomes they need and deserve. From the moment of the free initial consultation and through each in-person and virtual appointment, we work to minimize expense, delays and uncertainty at every stage. We strive to always serve clients' best interests, and we accept credit cards as payment.</p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]><style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; mso-para-margin-top:0cm; mso-para-margin-right:0cm; mso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; mso-para-margin-left:0cm; line-height:107%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language:EN-US; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;} </style><![endif]-->"
