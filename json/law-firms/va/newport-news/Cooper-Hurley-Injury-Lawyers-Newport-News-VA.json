    "description": "<p>Cooper Hurley Injury Lawyers has represented injury victims in Newport News on the Virginia Peninsula for decades. We focus exclusively on personal injury law and wrongful death and have experience handling a variety of accident and injury claims. Our Newport News client meeting location is conveniently located on Warwick Blvd. near Huntington Park. We maintain a main office in Norfolk and six other client meeting locations in the Tidewater area. </p><p>Newport News is the third biggest city in Hampton Roads. We help many Newport News residents who are hurt in auto accidents, slip and fall accidents or industrial incidents. Newport News is a congested city that sees numerous wrecks on I-664, the Monitor-Merrimac-Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, the James River Bridge, Jefferson Avenue and I-64.</p><p>With more than 55 years of combined experience, our attorneys are highly capable legal professionals. Founders John Cooper and Jim Hurley have both been selected for inclusion in Virginia Super Lawyers - an honor reserved for 5 percent of practicing lawyers in the state. Partner Bill O'Mara and attorney John Baker have been selected to be a Rising Stars, an accolade reserved for under 2.5 percent of lawyers in the state.Additionally, John Cooper and Jim Hurley have been rated AV Preeminent* by Martindale-Hubbell's peer review system. Our legacy continues as we fight tirelessly to protect plaintiffs' rights in the Hampton Roads region. Among other personal injury claims, we deal with:</p><p>• Car and truck accidents<br>• Motorcycle accidents<br>• Slip and fall cases and other premises liability<br>• Brain and spinal injuries<br>• Railroad and railroad worker accidents<br>• Wrongful death<br>• Pedestrian accidents<br>• Cycling accidents<br>• Children's injuries</p><p>Cooper Hurley Injury Lawyers has grown rapidly in recent years.
