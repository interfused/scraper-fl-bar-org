    "description": "<p>Since 1995, The Mike Morse Injury Law Firm has offered dedicated personal injury services to people in Southfield, and the Detroit metro area, as well as throughout the state of Michigan. The attorneys represent clients with claims involving matters such as motor vehicle, trucking and motorcycle accidents; animal bites; birth injuries; nursing home abuse; brain injuries; construction accidents; toxic torts; and wrongful death. Mr. Morse's team also assists people with Social Security Disability claims.</p><p>When people suffer injuries due to the negligent or reckless actions of others, they may be entitled to no-fault benefits such as payment of their associated medical expenses, attendant care benefits, recovery of lost wages and replacement services. Knowledgeable about the state's no-fault benefits and familiar with the ins and outs of the system, Mr. Morse's team strives to help people obtain the assistance they need and deserve after an accident.</p><p>Beginning with a free initial consultation, the law firm team talks to clients about the circumstances that led to their injuries, as well as how their lives and those of their families have been affected. Striving to see their clients made as close to whole as possible for their associated losses, the attorneys zealously seek the maximum compensation on their behalf. Over the years, Mr. Morse and his team have recovered more than $1 billion in total judgments and settlements on behalf of their clients.</p><p>Advocating for the interests of those harmed through the actions of others, The Mike Morse Injury Law Firm also represents employees whose rights have been violated in the workplace. When employers violate the Fair Labor Standards Act, it affects workers' ability to provide for themselves and their families. Seeking to hold employers accountable for such wrongdoing, the firm's team aggressively pursues employees' rights and best interests in cases involving wage and hour disputes.</p>"
