    "description": "<p>Morris &amp; Dean is a personal injury and criminal defense firm based in Dalton, Georgia. Our attorneys represent clients in northwest Georgia along the I-75 corridor and all surrounding areas.</p><h3>Experienced Attorneys Who Know How To Be Tough ... And When To Be Compassionate</h3><p>As a client, you should expect that your lawyer knows when to take an aggressive stance with the other side, whether that's a negligent party and its insurance companies or the government seeking a conviction in a criminal trial. You deserve to know that your lawyer has experience fighting in court and working at the negotiating table for favorable outcomes, and knows intuitively when to take a softer stance and when to take the gloves off.</p><p>What makes our firm unique is our attorneys' ability to understand where our clients are coming from, to offer them hope, and to fight aggressively in the legal system to make things right. Attorneys Marcus R. Morris and Jeffrey J. Dean know that getting legal help can be an intimidating if not outright scary process. Using six combined decades of accomplished legal experience and a sincere belief that people deserve compassionate legal help, they show our clients that it is possible to be treated with respect and empathy while knowing that their lawyer will do what it takes to resolve their cases successfully.</p><h3>A Focus On Personal Injury And Criminal Defense In Georgia</h3><p>Every legal case involves some kind of uncertainty. Personal injury and criminal cases, however, touch people's lives in ways few other types of legal claims do. Whether someone has been injured due to someone else's careless behavior, or has been accused of criminal activity that threatens their future and livelihood, the stakes are almost always high. Our attorneys fight to get our personal injury clients fair compensation for their injuries, and to keep our criminal defense clients from suffering the long-term impacts that accompany a criminal conviction in Georgia.</p><p>Contact our law firm to speak with one of our attorneys about your or your loved one's legal needs. We offer a no-fee consultation for personal injury cases.</p>"
