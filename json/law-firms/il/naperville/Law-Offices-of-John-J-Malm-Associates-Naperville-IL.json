    "description": "<p>My name is John J. Malm, and I founded my Naperville law firm, the Law Offices of John J. Malm &amp; Associates, P.C., in 2001 after spending nearly 10 years gaining experience representing the interests of plaintiffs in a wide variety of personal injury cases. In 2013, my two associate attorneys, Jason P. Schneider and Sara L. Ross, and I moved into our new offices, which allows us to utilize the latest technology as we assist clients from throughout Will and DuPage counties and surrounding northeastern Illinois.</p><p>I began my legal career in 1993 after earning my law degree from Valparaiso University Law School and my approval to practice law in the state of Illinois. After graduation, I immediately focused my career on personal injury law. I joined a large Illinois firm, where I represented plaintiffs in torts associated with catastrophic injury cases. After several years as an associate attorney, I formed a new law firm with a partner, where I remained until founding the Law Offices of John J. Malm &amp; Associates, P.C.</p><p>If you sustained a serious personal injury, whether at the hands of a negligent individual or in an explosion or public transportation accident, my legal team has the experience and knowledge to help you pursue the personal injury compensation you need to regain financial stability. If you are interested in learning more about my law firm, you can take advantage of my offer for a free initial consultation at my Naperville law office. </p>"
