    "description": "<p>A personal injury can have dire consequences on a person's finances and overall well-being. Unfortunately, as the attorneys at the law office of Greenblatt &amp; Veliev in Rockville, Maryland, we know all too well, insurance companies rarely treat victims' claims with the urgency they deserve. Notorious for putting profits over people, insurers attempt to avoid paying out large claims by delaying them, offering lowball settlements or denying them altogether. These unscrupulous tactics leave injured parties unable to pay their living expenses and, worse yet, receive the medical care they so desperately need. Our attorneys are familiar with insurers' tactics and combat them with tried and true strategies of their own.</p><p>With five highly educated and qualified attorneys on our roster, our law office has the capabilities to handle a diverse range of personal injury cases. Our track record includes favorable verdicts for claims arising out of the following types of accidents:</p><ul><li>Car accidents</li><li>Truck accidents</li><li>Mass transit and aviation accidents</li><li>Construction accidents</li><li>Dog bites</li><li>Medical malpractice</li><li>Nursing home abuse</li><li>Premises liability</li><li>Toxic torts</li><li>Workers' compensation</li><li>Wrongful death</li></ul><p>Our trial attorney also has extensive experience defending clients against criminal charges. Charges range in severity and may include traffic tickets, DUI/DWI, sexual abuse, domestic violence and neglect, and white collar crimes.</p><p>The law office of Greenblatt &amp; Veliev acts only with clients' best interests in mind. We use the free initial consultation to learn more about a client's case and to give them an opportunity to determine if we are a good fit for them.
