    "description": "<p>The Pendas Law Firm is a bilingual personal injury and insurance law firm that serves all of Florida from offices in Fort Myers, Orlando, Daytona Beach, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Bradenton, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Jacksonville. With many offices throughout Florida, we serve a greater number of people in dire need of legal support, especially those whose primary language is Spanish.</p><p>Several of our senior attorneys bring more than 20 years of litigation experience to our legal team, and the firm itself has been in operation since 2004. We serve and protect people who have sustained injuries, lost a loved one, or suffered other losses due to another party’s negligence.</p><p>Our trial lawyers handle personal injury cases involving medical malpractice, nursing home negligence, automobile accidents, unsafe premises and defective products. We also assist clients with insurance claims, personal injury protection (PIP) and uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. Many working Americans don’t have health insurance or disability insurance, and a sudden and serious injury can be devastating. We understand this, and are prepared to take on insurance providers, law enforcement officials and liable parties on your behalf. With our help, past clients have recovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal compensation for sustained injuries and losses suffered.</p><p>Client satisfaction is more than important to us – it’s why we do what we do. The Pendas Law Firm was founded in response to a growing need in Florida for high-level legal service and representation grounded in a genuine care and understanding of a client's situation. If you and your family are struggling to finance or otherwise overcome a recent accident or injury, contact our office in Ft. Myers for a free consultation to see how we can help. If other parties are at fault for the injury, we may be able to recover monetary compensation.</p>"
