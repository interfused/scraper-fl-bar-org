An experienced employment law attorney can help you determine qualifying instances. These are some examples that our law office has encountered while serving clients: </p><ul><li>Refusing to hire or promote someone because of a protected feature, such as race or sexual orientation</li><li>Making it difficult for returning mothers to resume their duties and advance within the organization</li><li>Demoting, firing or reducing the hours of someone who files a complaint or cooperates with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) </li></ul><p>All consultations with DeToffol &amp; Gittleman are confidential. Our law office does not charge a fee to explain what your rights are or to determine whether you have a strong enough case to move forward.
