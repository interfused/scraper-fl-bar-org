    "description": "<p>After a serious accident leaves victims unable to think clearly or plan for the legal process ahead, Gervelis Law Firm steps in to create breathing room. From our location in Warren, Ohio, we help people in the cities of Youngstown, Columbiana, East Liverpool and Akron find answers and peace in the wake of a devastating situation. We also extend our services to people in greater Mahoning, Trumbull, Portage, Columbiana and Summit counties.</p><p>Even when an accident seems straightforward, people are often shocked by the lack of inherent accountability of the other side. Whether our clients experienced a wrongful death in their family due to a defective medical device or were left with catastrophic injuries after a workplace accident, Gervelis Law Firm holds the negligent party accountable. With decades of experience advocating for victims, we treat every case as if we are heading to trial. Fortunately, in many situations, we are able to negotiate settlements without ever going to court.</p><p>In addition to medical malpractice and premises liability cases, we help those involved in car, truck and motorcycle accidents. Our attorneys are nuanced in each of these arenas. After investigating the cause of a crash, we assist clients in pursuing compensation for hospital bills, lost income, counseling and any other recovery needs or financial impact. We also act as spokespeople when it comes to insurance companies, for example, by ensuring they repair vehicles in a timely manner. At Gervelis Law Firm, our clients always come first. For this reason, we offer a free initial consultation and accept credit cards as payment.</p>"
