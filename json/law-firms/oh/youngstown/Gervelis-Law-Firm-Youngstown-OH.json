    "description": "<p>When people are hurt in Youngstown, Ohio, they turn to Gervelis Law Firm for aggressive representation. Beyond the physical wounds and emotional trauma that come after a personal injury, one of the most stressful prospects of the claims process is facing an insurance company in the courtroom. Even profit-minded insurers are no matches for our experienced legal team.

Whether our clients were injured in a rear-end collision or hit by a commercial 18-wheeler resulting in a wrongful death, we are there to help them pursue justice. They trust us to clear all legal red tape in a timely manner so they can focus on recovery.</p><p>In addition to vehicular accidents, Gervelis Law Firm takes cases involving medical malpractice, defective drugs, defective medical devices, premises liability and injuries on the job. These types of scenarios are rarely straightforward; we give our clients advice tailored to their specific circumstances so they are able to make the most informed decisions possible.</p><p>Because Gervelis Law Firm is committed to outstanding service, we offer a free initial consultation to prospective clients in Youngstown, Warren, Columbia, East Liverpool and Akron, Ohio, as well as the counties of Portage, Mahoning, Trumbull, Columbiana and Summit.
