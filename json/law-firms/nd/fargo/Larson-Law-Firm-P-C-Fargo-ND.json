    "description": "<p>Attorney Mark V. Larson founded our Fargo law office, Larson Law Firm P.C., in 1979 with the goal of protecting the rights of victims of negligence in western North Dakota. More than 35 years later, he and his legal team continue to work toward his original goal by representing the interests of clients suffering personal injuries or losses in the aftermath of:</p><ul><li>Car, truck and motorcycle accidents</li><li>Traumatic brain injuries</li><li>Wrongful death</li><li>Oilfield and farm accidents</li><li>Electrocution and burn injuries</li></ul><p>Along with the increase in oil production in North Dakota, an increase in personal injuries has occurred. Mr. Larson and our associate attorney, Jared W. Gietzen, have nearly 40 years of combined legal experience helping injured North Dakotans and their families pursue the compensation they need for secure futures.</p><p>If you or someone you love suffered injuries in any type of accident and a negligent individual or business is responsible, you can turn to Larson Law Firm P.C. for the guidance and support you need throughout the legal process. If you would like to discuss your situation with one of our attorneys, you can do so during a free initial consultation at our Fargo law office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
