    "description": "<p>I founded my Houston law firm, Charles J. Argento &amp; Associates, after having spent 10 years representing defendants in civil matters. Armed with this experience, I knew that I could lead a firm dedicated to representing plaintiffs. I now focus on representing injured victims and their families as they pursue personal injury or wrongful death compensation. My dedication and my record of success lead countless clients from Texas' Gulf Coast region to my firm each year for assistance with matters related to the following:</p><ul><li>Motor vehicle accidents</li><li>Dangerous and defective products</li><li>Medical malpractice</li><li>Premises liability</li></ul><p>In addition to my highly respected personal injury practice, I also offer assistance to clients with needs in two other practice areas. I guide those who have suffered on-the-job injuries through the workers' compensation claims and appeals processes. In addition, I offer representation to those in the Houston area who face charges for driving while intoxicated.</p><p>Regardless of the area into which your legal need falls, you can put your trust in my experienced hands.
