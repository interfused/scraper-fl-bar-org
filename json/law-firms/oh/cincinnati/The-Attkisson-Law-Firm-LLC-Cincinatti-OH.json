    "description": "<p>When injured parties in Cincinnati wish to hold negligent parties accountable for their injuries, they turn to The Attkisson Law Firm, LLC. Because of our commitment to serving victims and fighting for justice, we never represent insurance companies.</p><h2>Our approach</h2><p>Our greatest concern when we handle your personal injury case is your health. Our law firm tries to reduce your involvement in the case to as little as possible so you can focus your attention on healing. While you rest, we go to bat for you. More often than not, this involves going up against insurance companies only looking to fatten their pockets with high premiums and low payouts.</p><h2>Our results</h2><p>Sometimes we win big, sometimes we win small and sometimes we don't win at all. Even so, we have a reputation for winning, and we leave no stone unturned in our pursuit to achieve this. Some of the cases we are most proud of involve multimillion-dollar settlements for our clients. </p><h2>Our experience</h2> At The Attkisson Law Firm, LLC, we have years of trial experience as a team and look forward to applying this experience to your case. Over the years, we have worked hard to hone our skills. We have also paid keen attention to the tactics used by insurance companies, so we can counter them. Because of our commitment to ensuring clients can access our services, the first consultation is free.<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal 0 false false false EN-IN X-NONE X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]><style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; mso-para-margin-top:0cm; mso-para-margin-right:0cm; mso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; mso-para-margin-left:0cm; line-height:107%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style><![endif]-->"
