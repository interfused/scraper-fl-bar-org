    "description": "<p>When people cause injuries due to carelessness or a disregard for others' safety, victims may seek to hold them accountable for the damages. We at LaVoie &amp; Kaizer, P.A., in Tampa, Florida, fight for those who suffer injuries in motor vehicle collisions, construction accidents, admiralty and maritime incidents, aviation and mass transit accidents, premises liability matters and animal attacks.</p><p>Product manufacturers, medical professionals and nursing home staff all have a duty to uphold certain standards for safety. A faulty product, a missed diagnosis or an abusive nursing home aide can put lives at risk. When injuries are fatal, our law firm represents family members of the victim in wrongful death lawsuits. We also handle cases for victims of sexual abuse, assault and battery.</p><p>We keep our fees lower than the standard rates, and the law firm accepts credit cards to ease financial matters for our clients. However, they only pay us if they receive a settlement or award. Our attorneys work one-on-one with clients to create a customized legal strategy to seek maximum compensation.</p><p>Our law firm offers free initial consultations where we listen to clients' stories and begin to lay the foundation for their next steps. Clients of LaVoie &amp; Kaizer, P.A., receive customized strategies that take the unique details of their case into account. In addition to our offices in Tampa, Orlando and Clearwater, we meet with clients through virtual appointments for their convenience. </p>"
