    "description": "<p>The Law Office of Peter J. Casey, LLC, protects the interests of injured people in West Hartford, Connecticut, and beyond. My mission is to help people with severe injuries - and their families -recover from these types of traumatic events.</p><p><strong>Negotiating With Insurance Companies</strong></p><p>Many insurance companies provide low settlement offers at first, attempting to convince injured people that the reduced amount is reasonable. My law office understands how insurance adjusters work, and I am ready to negotiate in order to make our clients whole.</p><p>Issues typically become more complicated once someone accepts an offer. I would urge anyone considering this type of deal to understand the entire situation before making any type of agreement.</p><p><strong>Taking Matters To Court</strong></p><p>If insurers do not see reason during negotiations, or if clients come to us further along in the process, I am able to litigate personal injury cases. In fact, one of the reasons I have been such a successful negotiator is that I prepare cases for trial from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Providing Compassionate Counsel</strong></p><p>At the Law Office of Peter J. Casey, LLC, clients come first. I respond quickly, communicate clearly and provide a compassionate legal point of view on these life-changing losses. In addition to our personal injury practice, which includes car accidents and other disasters, and also handle matters of probate litigation and estate administration. Free consultations are available.</p><p></p>"
