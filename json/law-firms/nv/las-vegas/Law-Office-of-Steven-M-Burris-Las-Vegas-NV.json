    "description": "<p>For 40 years, the Law Office of Steven M. Burris in Las Vegas, Nevada, has aggressively advocated for victims of personal injury. When the liable party refuses to take responsibility for his or her negligence, and when insurers routinely push your needs aside, our firm is ready and willing to step in and provide the award-winning representation your case deserves. You can count on our firm to tirelessly pursue the compensation you need to recover in financial comfort.</p><p>Our law office focuses exclusively on personal injury cases. Over the past four decades, we have helped clients recover multimillion-dollar verdicts for birth injuries, brain injuries, car and truck accident injuries, wrongful death, medical malpractice and nursing home abuse and neglect. Though wrongful termination does not result in physical harm, it can result in financial harm. It is in our wheelhouse to assist clients with these latter types of cases as well.</p><p>Both opposing counsel and the Las Vegas court system hold attorney Steven M. Burris in the highest regard. He has a solid reputation for providing compassionate, honest and formidable representation to injured parties who put their trust in him. This reputation has earned him a spot on the <em>Las Vegas Life</em> Top 5 Lawyer list.</p><p>Because the Law Office of Steven M. Burris knows how costly a personal injury can be, we strive to make things as easy on our clients as possible. One way we do this is by offering free consultations.</p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal 0 false false false EN-IN X-NONE X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]><style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; mso-para-margin-top:0cm; mso-para-margin-right:0cm; mso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; mso-para-margin-left:0cm; line-height:107%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style><![endif]-->"
