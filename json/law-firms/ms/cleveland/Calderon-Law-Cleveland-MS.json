    "description": "<p>Facing criminal charges can be a frightening and stressful experience. Providing dedicated legal representation, Calderon Law proudly serves people in the Cleveland, Mississippi, area. Recognizing that criminal charges may jeopardize their freedom and their futures, we aggressively advocate on behalf of those we represent and strive to help them achieve the best possible outcomes to their cases. For the convenience of our clients, we accept credit cards.</p><p>Founded with the purpose of providing client-focused services and helping people to resolve their legal issues so they can move forward, our law firm never treats clients as just another case file or number. Passionate about protecting the rights of those we represent, we have represented clients in a range of complex matters, including DUI. Our attorneys seek to limit the consequences of our clients' arrests, and we have successfully obtained dismissals and acquittals, as well as pleaded down charges on their behalf.</p><p>While legal issues may share similarities, our attorneys know every case is different. Beginning with a free initial consultation, we listen to our clients and discuss the details of their cases with them. Working closely with those we represent throughout the criminal process, our team crafts personal strategies that incorporate their specific needs and goals.</p><p>We also handle car wreck and other personal injury cases. The attorneys at Calderon Law know that suffering harm due to the negligence or carelessness of another can be emotionally draining. Approaching these matters with the same dedication and vigor as we do our criminal cases, our team strives to help those we represent obtain the maximum compensation.</p>"
