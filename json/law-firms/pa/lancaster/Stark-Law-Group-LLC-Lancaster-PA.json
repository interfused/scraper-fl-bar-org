    "description": "<p>My name is Eric Stark, principal attorney of Stark Law Group, LLC. We serve all Pennsylvania employees with workplace injuries.</p><p>Aside from workers' compensation, I also handle every type of employee-side labor and employment law. I have spent over 15 years building my reputation as an attorney who gets workers what they deserve.</p><p><strong>Focused Experience</strong></p><p>I have extensive experience with the legal side of many complex labor law issues. That includes ERISA claims, FELA cases (railroad worker injuries), whistleblower cases, discrimination, wrongful termination and more.</p><p>However, a law office needs more than just a successful track record. I also have experience with the human side. I understand what workers are going through when they face off against their employers. I know the judges, I'm acquainted with my adversaries, and I have a keen sense of which arguments will get my clients' points across to the people who matter.</p><p><strong>Expansive Knowledge</strong></p><p>Experience is not enough to get the best possible outcome for a case. I also take the time to learn about the specific situation my client faces. I put that information in the context of the law, medicine and any applicable regulations before I build my strategy.</p><p><strong>Personal Attention</strong></p><p>My name is on the door here at Stark Law Group, LLC, and my reputation is at stake whenever I take a client. That is why I make sure that every case gets the personal attention it deserves. Free consultations are available. I also accept credit cards and provide the option for virtual meetings outside of the physical law office location.</p>"
