    "description": "<p>The Law Firm of John W. Lee, PC has office locations in Newport News, Hampton, Chesapeake, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. We have six experienced attorneys on staff that focus their practice in the areas of bankruptcy, family law, criminal defense, and estate planning. With over 90 years of combined legal experience our attorneys are ready to help you face your legal challenges.</p><p>Our attorneys have helped thousands of people eliminate debt through the bankruptcy process. If you are struggling with garnishments, repossessions, collection calls, or foreclosure you should call us for a free consultation. Our attorneys are trained to help you find the best possible solution to help manage your debt, even if the answer is not filing bankruptcy. If bankruptcy is not right for you, we may be able to help you negotiate settlements with your creditors.</p><p>Bankruptcy is not the only thing we do. Our attorneys have helped thousands of people file divorce in Virginia, both contested and uncontested. We also understand the unique challenges divorce presents military personnel. We can help you with child custody, support, or visitation matters. Other things we handle include guardianships and adoptions. </p><p>Even if you are not facing an immediate legal crisis, you may need us to help you prepare a simple Last Will and Testament, Power-of-Attorney, or Advanced Medical Directive. We offer very competitive flat fee pricing for basic estate planning documents and packages.</p><p>I canâ€™t tell you how many times I have been told by a client facing a crisis that he wished he had talked to me before he had taken whatever action that caused him to be sitting in my office. In many cases, I could have saved him a lot of heartache and money if I had the opportunity to advise him earlier, before he signed that contract or made that assumption that landed him in hot water. For folks that just want to have me look over a document or discuss a situation before an action is taken or a mistake made, we offer very simple, easy flat fee consultation.</p><p>We understand that sometimes lawyers can be expensive; so, to help our clients access the help they need we offer easy payment plans on most legal services.</p><p>We are a debt relief agency. We help people file for bankruptcy relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>"
