    "description": "<p>At the Law Offices of Anthony Urban, P.C., in Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, injured people seeking justice after a preventable accident find passionate, experienced attorneys committed to obtaining the maximum compensation they deserve. We offer customized services that begin with a free initial consultation, and clients throughout central, southeastern and northern Pennsylvania who cannot come to one of our three office locations can meet with us through virtual appointments.</p><p>Everyone should do what they can to prevent accidents, but when people are careless, reckless or violent, they should be held accountable for the harm they cause. Whether the responsible party is a physician making a mistake, a distracted driver, a dog owner, a negligent property owner or a nursing home staff member, we are ready to take them to court to fight for our clients' rights. When an injury is fatal, we advocate for family members in wrongful death cases. The Law Offices of Anthony Urban, P.C., also handles cases involving:</p><ul><li>Birth injuries</li><li>Brain injuries</li><li>Asbestos mesothelioma</li><li>Sexual abuse</li><li>Construction accidents</li><li>Class actions</li><li>Toxic mold</li><li>Toxic torts</li></ul><p>Fault is not always a factor in receiving compensation. Programs such as workers' compensation, Social Security Disability and FELA are set up to help injured workers get back on their feet by covering medical expenses and a portion of lost wages while they recover. Applications can become complicated, though. We assist workers in filling out paperwork, gathering documentation and, if necessary, appealing denials.</p><p>The attorneys at the Law Offices of Anthony Urban, P.C., also defend clients against criminal charges, including DUI. We represent those whose civil rights have been violated, and we assist with end-of-life planning matters such as wills, trusts and powers of attorney, as well.</p>"
