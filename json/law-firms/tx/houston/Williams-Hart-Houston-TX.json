    "description": "<p>Since 1983, the team at our law firm, Williams Hart, has been staunch advocates of people who have suffered a personal injury. Serving the Houston, Texas, area, we aggressively pursue maximum compensation on behalf of clients in matters such as the following:</p><ul><li>Mesothelioma</li><li>Harmful pharmaceuticals and defective products</li><li>Car, trucking, maritime and aviation accidents</li><li>Workplace accidents and wrongful death</li></ul><p>Our results speak for themselves, as we have secured billions of dollars for our clients. For example, when two women experienced damages to their heart valves in connection with taking a diet product, our law firm returned a $200 million jury verdict. In a wrongful death case, we obtained more than $22 million for the family of a man who was killed in an explosion for which a large corporation was responsible.</p><p>We are prepared to battle any defendant, whether it is a Fortune 500 company, an insurance provider or manufacturer. Our attorneys have experience fighting big tobacco companies, and Monsanto Company, to name a few. For their accomplishments, our team has earned honors that include being listed in The National Trial Lawyers: Top 100; attorneys of the firm being included in the Super Lawyers list; and holding an Avvo \"Superb\" rating.</p><p>The Texas Board of Legal Specialization has certified several of our attorneys in personal injury trial law. Williams Hart also handles business law cases that include fraud and intellectual property disputes. Our law firm provides free initial consultations.</p>"
