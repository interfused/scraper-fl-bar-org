That way, our clients receive the same skilled representation as the powerful individuals, corporations and employers that harmed them.</p><p>We treat our clients like they're our family. That means we give every case the same degree of care it would receive if it involved a member of our household. Additionally, we give our clients our personal cell phone numbers. Thus, our clients can reach us whenever they have a question or concern. </p><p>We are Million Dollar Advocates members. Trial lawyers must win a million-dollar jury verdict to qualify for Million Dollar Advocates membership. Fewer than 1% of American lawyers earn that distinction.</p><p>We also won a $15 million dollar jury verdict in 2016 in a wrongful death case. That verdict was upheld on appeal in 2020.</p><p>Call us now for a free consultation. We look forward to working with you.</p>"
