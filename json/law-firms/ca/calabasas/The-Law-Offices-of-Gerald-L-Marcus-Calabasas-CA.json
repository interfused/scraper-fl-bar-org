    "description": "<p>A personal injury does more than cause physical pain; it can create emotional suffering and professional hardships. At The Law Offices of Gerald L. Marcus in Calabasas, California, we have a large team of experienced litigators who understand these damages. More importantly, we have a proven history of obtaining results for people who have experienced wrongdoing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of whether we are pursuing compensation in a case involving a catastrophic injury, defective product or property owner negligence, we take the same aggressive stance in holding the responsible party accountable. In one case, the attorneys at our law offices handled a wrongful death lawsuit that involved a drunk driver who caused a motor vehicle accident, obtaining a $5 million stipulated judgment on our client’s behalf. After a 4-year-old girl suffered a dog bite, we pursued a $500,000 settlement when the insurance company refused to take responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These case results and countless others are symptomatic of the results-oriented approach our attorneys use. The Law Offices of Gerald L. Marcus has recovered more than $125 million for our clients in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, as well as those throughout the San Fernando Valley. We offer free initial consultations to prospective clients and accept credit cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
