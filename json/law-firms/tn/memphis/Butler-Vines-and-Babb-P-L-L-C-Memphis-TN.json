    "description": "<p>Butler, Vines and Babb is a Knoxville, Tennessee based law firm that was established in 1973 by attorneys who had already been working together for several years. When first organized, the firm focused on trial work, but diversified over the years to serve the many needs of an expanding client list. Although the firm and the areas of practice have grown, its members remain dedicated to the small-firm concept of providing quality legal services on a personal basis. Those same proficiencies remain the cornerstone of a growing and diverse practice, encompassing many areas of personal injury law, insurance defense, corporate and banking, estate planning and alternative dispute resolution (mediation).</p><p>The firm routinely works with highly complex, high risk, and high profile litigation, and often serves at the request of other law firms to support and advise key attorneys and, in selected plaintiff personal injury cases, may advance the costs of trial preparation, and share fees, with referring and participating firms. Furthermore, the firm has acted as regional coordinating counsel and as trial counsel throughout the southeastern and midwestern United States, supervising thousands of cases in these jurisdictions. Butler, Vines and Babb is rated an \"AV\" firm by Martindale Hubbell, representing the \"highest level of professional excellence\".</p><p>Members of the firm actively conduct seminars and present papers on a number of legal issues, and many of our attorneys have been honored by their peers. Select members of the firm are certified as Civil Trial Specialists by the Tennessee Commission on Continuing Legal Education and Specialization or are listed as Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 31 Mediators. In addition, Butler, Vines and Babb employs a Medical Doctor and a Registered Nurse as medical consultants for the purpose of reviewing medical issues in both our plaintiff and defense cases. The firm also has established contacts with physicians at medical institutions who are willing to assist with an objective analysis of potential cases. Above all, our members strongly believe that the diversity of practice areas and people within our firm gives us an advantage in serving your needs, whether working on plaintiff or defense matters.</p>"
