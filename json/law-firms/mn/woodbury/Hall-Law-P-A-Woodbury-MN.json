    "description": "<p><strong>The Pursuit Of Justice For Minnesota Residents Starts Here</strong></p><p>At Hall Law P.A., we are passionate about justice, particularly for fellow Woodbury residents and those throughout Minnesota. Accidents caused by negligent actions that result in catastrophic injuries or death require immediate action. The selection of a personal injury attorney is the first step in a long road toward justice. For victims of car crashes or defective products, justice comes in the form of compensation for the damages and losses they suffered.</p><p>The attorneys at our firm possess decades of experience in all phases of personal injury litigation, from the pretrial process to appeals. They have received statewide recognition for significant, record-setting damage recoveries in Minnesota, including one of the largest whiplash injury verdicts in state history.</p><p><strong>Taking On All Types Of Personal Injury Claims</strong></p><p>While a majority of cases involve catastrophic injuries and substantial economic losses, we do take the time to review and take on smaller injury cases. Our legal team believes that everyone deserves fair treatment and justice. Regardless of the extent of the victim's injuries or the size of a settlement or verdict, individualized legal representation is vital in identifying the specific issues and goals of any personal injury claim.</p><p>As each year passes, personal injury cases become more challenging. The opposition continues to increase its power and influence. Countering the resources of insurance companies is a challenge our attorneys are willing to face on behalf of our clients. Our lawyers continue to refine their trial skills and strategies while expanding their legal knowledge.</p><p>Our law firm is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. We can also meet on evenings and weekends by appointment.</p>"
