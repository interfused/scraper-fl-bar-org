    "description": "<p>There is no substitute for decades of experience spent winning multimillion-dollar settlements and verdicts in medical malpractice cases. At The Eisen Law Firm, we have done exactly that by focusing exclusively on cases involving medical negligence and wrongful death.</p><p>From our office in Cleveland, we represent victims of medical negligence throughout Ohio, including Lorain, Columbus, Toledo and Akron. Over the past 40 years, we have become known for the caliber of our litigation, our network of reputable medical experts and our commitment to success. As a result, most if not all of our clients are referred to us by past clients and other attorneys in the area. </p><p>Attorney Brian N. Eisen obtained his Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1992. He worked for the United States Court of Appeals for the 9<sup>th</sup> Circuit, then as a trial attorney for the United States Department of Justice before joining our firm. A leader in his legal community, Mr. Eisen is regularly invited to speak at seminars about litigation, trial procedure and medical malpractice, and is a present member of numerous advocacy associations, including the American Association for Justice, the Ohio Association for Justice and the Million Dollar Advocates Forum. He is also past president of the Cleveland Academy of Trial Lawyers. Mr Eisen was selected for inclusion in Ohio Super Lawyers in 2007 and has been included every year since.</p><p>The difference between choosing an average attorney and a pre-eminent one can be the difference between losing and getting full compensation for your injuries. At The Eisen Law Firm, we aggressively pursue justice in the form of maximum compensation for each of our clients. </p>"
