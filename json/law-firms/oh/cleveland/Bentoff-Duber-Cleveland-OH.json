    "description": "<p>The legal system should establish justice in every case. At Bentoff &amp; Duber, in Cleveland, Ohio, our goal is to help clients obtain the legal outcome they seek, whether that be a personal injury verdict or settlement, workers' compensation or some other solution that restores a client's rights.</p><p><strong>Negligence claims</strong><br>Most accidents happen because an individual or an entity did not fulfill the duty to take proper care while doing something such as driving a large truck or performing a medical procedure, and the victim has the right to hold the responsible party liable. In addition to motor vehicle accidents and medical malpractice, our law office handles the following: </p><ul><li>Nursing home abuse</li><li>Sexual abuse</li><li>Slip-and-fall accidents</li><li>Drunk driving accidents</li><li>Workplace injuries</li><li>Toxic torts</li></ul><p>Our law office also takes wrongful death cases when families need representation because a loved one died as a result of someone else's carelessness, recklessness or wrongdoing. </p><p><strong>Compensation for damages</strong><br>While we may negotiate for a settlement, we only advise accepting when it is enough to cover all the damages our client has suffered. Our attorneys are prepared to take cases to court if necessary to fight for maximum compensation for our clients.</p><p>Often, our clients have additional options for financial assistance. We help them file for Social Security Disability benefits, Social Security retirement and survivors benefits when they are eligible. The law office of Bentoff &amp; Duber offers free initial consultations and virtual appointment options.</p>"
