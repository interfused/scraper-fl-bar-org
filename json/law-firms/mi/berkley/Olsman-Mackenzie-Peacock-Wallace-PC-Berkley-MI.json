    "description": "<p>Neglect and abuse in nursing homes take a physical and emotional toll on their victims. At the Olsman Mackenzie Peacock &amp; Wallace PC law firm in Berkley, Michigan, we have seen firsthand how devastating neglect can be. Illnesses, physical injuries and psychological damage can occur when the people entrusted to care for someone shirk their responsibilities and act negligently.</p><p>Our skilled attorneys will not tolerate caregivers or facilities that mistreat residents and patients. Throughout the state, we have a track record of holding these establishments and their staff accountable for the damages they cause. Throughout our law firm’s history, we have obtained settlements and verdicts in our clients’ favor, granting them the compensation they need to begin healing from the abuse. While we cannot undo the harm they and their loved ones have experienced, we do everything we can to help take the financial burden off our clients.</p><p>To start the road to recovery, clients may schedule a free initial consultation with one of our experienced trial attorneys. We will take the time to understand what has transpired and then begin collecting evidence and building a compelling case. At Olsman Mackenzie Peacock &amp; Wallace PC, we promptly respond to all clients’ concerns and questions so they have clarity regarding their options and can make informed decisions. Our law firm also has offices in Battle Creek and Lapeer.</p>"
