    "description": "<p><strong>Are You Getting The Benefits You Deserve?</strong></p><p>Florida law guarantees workers compensation when their on-the-job injuries prevent them from working. Nevertheless, many employers and insurance carriers fail to meet even the basic requirements of the law.</p><p>If you suffered a workplace injury and need help, contact <strong>Rooth Law Firm, P.A.,</strong> in Seminole, Florida. We know the rules for workers' compensation and hold employers and insurance companies to those rules, so our clients can receive the full amount of compensation due to them for their medical bills, lost wages, temporary disability and other losses.</p><p><strong>Our Lawyer Is Board Certified In Workers' Compensation</strong></p><p>Our founding lawyer, Joseph Rooth is board certified in workers' compensation law by the Florida Bar Association. Very few Florida lawyers have earned this distinction, which identifies him as a knowledgeable practitioner of workers' compensation law in the state.</p><p>Mr. Rooth also has years of experience in helping workers who are disabled long term. If you have been out of work more than a year due to a workplace disability, he can help you obtain Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits through the federal government. If you have applied for SSD in the past and been denied, he can appeal your application and correct any errors that may have prevented acceptance previously.</p><p><strong>Contact Our Social Security Disability Lawyer</strong></p><p>Both workers' compensation and SSD laws and procedures are complicated and fraught with pitfalls, but our law firm can succeed where others fail. Contact Rooth Law Firm, P.A., in Seminole today, for a free consultation in which we can discuss your options. If your injury prevents you from traveling to one of our offices in Seminole, Spring Hill, Clearwater, or New Port Richey, our attorney can come to you. We offer flexible hours, so we can meet where you need us, and when you need us. </p><p>For more information, contact our law firm online or by calling 727-849-3400.</p>"
