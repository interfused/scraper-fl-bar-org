    "description": "<p><strong>RESULTS.</strong> We have a 99% winning percentage. We have secured millions of dollars for our clients. We know how to fight and we know how to win.</p><p><strong>AVAILABILITY.</strong> Access to your attorney is important. Whether you call Michael at the office, on his cell, through text, or email, availability is never an issue. Nothing is more frustrating to a client than being unable to speak with their attorney.</p><p><strong>COMMUNICATION.</strong> Fancy legal talk is annoying. Nobody outside the law understands it. Michael explains complex legal issues in plain English, and provides step-by-step guidance from start to finish. Equally important is the skill of listening to the client. An attorney must be able to take the time to listen and understand the client's story, and the harm that was done. Only then can the attorney effectively argue the case to get maximum compensation.</p><p><strong>HAPPY CLIENTS.</strong> We have numerous 5-star client reviews on Google and other online platforms that continue to grow. Knowing what past clients have experienced is the best way to know what you're getting.</p>"
