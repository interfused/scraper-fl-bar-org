    "description": "<h2><strong>Changing Laws. Saving Lives. </strong></h2><p>At the New Mexico law firm of McGinn, Montoya, Love &amp; Curry, PA, we have earned a respected reputation for representing the rights and interests of individuals facing the injustices and wrongdoing of major corporations, medical providers and governmental entities. In fact, over the past 25 years, we have recovered many multimillion-dollar verdicts and settlements in such \"David versus Goliath\" cases. Such results range from $67.3 million recovered for the wrongful implant of a pacemaker to $52 million recovered for the death of a convenience store clerk. </p><p>Our philosophy is that the law should be a force for good. Because of this, our attorneys vigorously pursue not only monetary compensation for our personal injury clients, but we also demand safety changes to protect other individuals and families from suffering similar harm. In essence, we take the cases that make a difference — forcing businesses, government agencies and others to change dangerous policies and correct negligent behavior. </p><p>Whether your case involves a defective product, a reckless driver, a careless physician, police misconduct or other wrongdoing, you can rely on the lawyers of MCML to be your strong advocates. Contact our office in Albuquerque to set up a free initial consultation about your case today. We look forward to talking with you. </p><p><strong><em>Se habla español</em></strong></p>"
