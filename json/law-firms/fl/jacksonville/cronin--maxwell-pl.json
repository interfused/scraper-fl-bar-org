Cronin and Gregory H. Maxwell, who are committed to providing personal attention to each of our clients. We have the experience and resources to take on substantial claims against powerful defendants.</p><p><strong>Doing Whatever It Takes to Win Justice for Our Clients</strong></p><p>It can take a great deal of hard work to achieve a fair outcome in a medical malpractice case. It is important to retain a law firm that will start that work right away, taking whatever steps are necessary to document your claim, protect your rights and pursue fair compensation.</p><p>If you have been injured, your condition has gotten worse or a loved one has died as a result of anything a doctor, hospital or other medical provider did or failed to do, we encourage you to contact us to discuss what we can do to help you obtain the results you deserve.</p><p><strong>Call 904-302-6414 to Discuss How We Can Help You</strong></p><p>At some law firms, you may never get to speak to a lawyer about your case.
