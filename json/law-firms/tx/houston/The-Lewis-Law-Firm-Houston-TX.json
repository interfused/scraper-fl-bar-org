    "description": "<p>When I founded my practice, The Lewis Law Firm, in Houston, Texas, I did so with the goal of helping injured parties collect the compensation they need and deserve to recover in comfort. Unfortunately, insurers and at-fault parties regularly try to skirt their financial obligations through aggressive and often morally corrupt practices. At-fault parties may try to deny their role in an accident, while insurers may attempt to reduce a claimant's compensation or avoid paying altogether. I am familiar with such tactics and use my negotiation skills, knowledge of the law and experience to ensure my clients get the compensation they deserve.</p><p>The Lewis Law Firm is equipped to handle all types of personal injury matters. In addition to the ability to navigate clients through the typical car and truck accident claims, I am more than prepared to tackle complex cases such as those involving brain injury, catastrophic injury, medical malpractice, defective drugs, medical devices, premises liability and product liability. I also take on class action lawsuits and wrongful death cases.</p><p>I have the honor of being included on the Texas Super Lawyers list every year since 2008. I held the role of National President for the American Board of Trial Advocates in 2010. My law firm accepts credit cards as payment and offers free consultations.</p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]><style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; mso-para-margin-top:0cm; mso-para-margin-right:0cm; mso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; mso-para-margin-left:0cm; line-height:107%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language:EN-US; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;} </style><![endif]-->"
