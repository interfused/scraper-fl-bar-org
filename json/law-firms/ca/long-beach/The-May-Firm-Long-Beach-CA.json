    "description": "<p>Routinely securing seven- and eight-figure awards on behalf of personal injury victims is what we do at The May Firm. From our Carlsbad, California, location as well as six other law offices, we serve people in Fresno, Bakersfield, San Diego, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura. We offer free initial consultations to people in the area who have suffered harm due to someone else’s negligence.</p><p>For their exceptional results, the attorneys at our law offices hold honors such as being listed in The National Trial Lawyers: Top 40 under 40; earning an Avvo “Superb” rating; receiving membership in the Million Dollar Advocates Forum and the Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum; and being selected for the National Academy of Personal Injury Attorneys’ Top 10 Under 40. These accolades do not compare, however, to the satisfaction we get from helping clients overcome the physical, emotional and financial strains that personal injuries create.</p><p>The personal injury practice at our law offices covers a number of incidents such as car, truck and motorcycle accidents; dog bites and slip and falls; defective products and product liability; and wrongful death incidents. We know how to illustrate every damage and every dollar lost in order to recoup maximum compensation. To best accommodate our clients, The May Firm accepts credit cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
