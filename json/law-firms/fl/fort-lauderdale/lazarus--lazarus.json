    "description": "<p>Insurance companies in Florida would rather spend millions to lobby in D.C. than give those millions to injured victims. Consequently, injured people in Fort Lauderdale rely on our firm, Lazarus &amp; Lazarus, to protect their best interests and fight for compensation. We know our clients have more important things to focus on than whether or not they receive compensation, but we also know financial stability will matter more once recovery sets in.</p><p>Compensation can cover bills, make up for lost income and help families get back on track. These are some of the many areas of personal injury and wrongful death cases handled by our law firm:</p><blockquote style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: medium none; padding: 0px\"><p>• Auto accidents<br>• Trucking accidents<br>• Motorcycle accidents<br>• Uber and Lyft accidents<br>• Premises Liability </p></blockquote><p>Since our law firm first opened its doors in 1992, we have taken a client-focused approach to build and defend our cases. The attorneys on our team have dedicated their legal careers to representing victims and have no interest in playing both sides of the field by also representing insurance companies. Our commitment has earned us big wins and acceptance into the prestigious Million Dollar Advocates Forum.</p><p>Putting our clients first has also led to several success stories we are extremely proud of. For example, we were able to settle at $1.75 million for a motorcycle accident. The initial consultation with our law firm is free, at our main office or our branch office in Weston.</p>"
