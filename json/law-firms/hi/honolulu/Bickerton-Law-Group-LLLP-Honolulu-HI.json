    "description": "<p>Any courtroom appearance in Honolulu, Hawaii, presents an opportunity for stress and uncertainty. Our goal at Bickerton Dang, LLLP, is to translate the procedural rules and legalese for you to make the process less intimidating. Our attorneys have extensive litigation experience in Honolulu County working with plaintiffs, respondents and other parties who are dealing with matters such as personal injury, business disputes, environmental concerns and consumer class actions.</p><p>Many people think of a trial as simply the time spent in court. In truth, your case could involve pre-trial hearings, motions and poring over paperwork. The attorneys at our law firm are honest and aggressive in every phase because each step is crucial in securing the outcome you want. The time we spend working with you outside the courtroom pays off when we get to trial.</p><p>Your rights are on the line no matter which side of the case you stand. Also at risk are your time and resources. Working with our law firm gives you the opportunity to move through legal proceedings with confidence and efficiency. Though we focus mostly on litigation, our attorneys are proficient at alternative dispute resolution tactics such as settlements and mediation. At Bickerton Dang, LLLP, we offer free initial consultations and accept credit cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
