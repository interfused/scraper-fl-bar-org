    "description": "<p>Advocating for plaintiffs in personal injury cases in Kansas City, Missouri, our attorneys at The Nail Law Firm are highly experienced in matters ranging from medical malpractice to trucking accidents to wrongful death. We know that the vast majority of these issues are settled before ever reaching the courtroom. Regardless, we believe our clients deserve to have their voices heard. Our team shares their stories and illustrates their damages in order to recover compensation.</p><p>Starting with a free initial consultation, each case at our law firm is approached in the same manner: With a goal of returning a significant award. We have done just that time and again such as securing $2.5 million in a drunk driving accident and reaching a $1 million verdict in a medical malpractice case.</p><p>These awards are just a few of the reasons clients turn to us for representation. We also rise above other practices for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>We have spent decades handling personal injury cases.</li><li>Our founding attorney formerly represented insurance providers and brings that insight to our practice.</li><li>We have been selected for inclusion in the Super Lawyers list and in The National Trial Lawyers: Top 100.</li><li>We have two convenient offices from which we serve clients.</li></ul><p>Our team at The Nail Law Firm is also highly involved in the legal community. We are members of the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Association, the Missouri Bar Association and the American Association for Justice. To accommodate our clients, we accept credit cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
