    "description": "<span style=\"font-family: -webkit-standard\"><p style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0in 0in 12pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Pollock Cohen LLP is quickly gaining a reputation as one of New York's <span style=\"font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px\">— </span>indeed one of the nation's <span style=\"font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px\">—</span> leading whistleblower law firms. Just two years old, but comprised of six experienced, tough, and creative attorneys, Pollock Cohen LLP should be on most whistlerblower's must-talk-to lists.</p></span><span style=\"font-family: -webkit-standard\"><p style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0in 0in 12pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Our clients come from the greater New York City area, across the nation, and throughout the world. Our primary focus is in whistleblower representation, with many cases arising under the Federal and State False Claims Acts, other whistleblower laws, and often emerging out of retaliation against employees. Our other areas of expertise range from commercial disputes to class actions to judgement enforcement matters. The New York-based firm is known for its expertise in helping individuals and businesses deal with a wide array of serious and complex legal challenges. Our attorneys possess top-flight legal experience and unusual, diverse backgrounds that make us particularly well-suited to handle client needs. We offer skills, experience, and a perspective shared by few other law firms. And we've been called bulldogs more than once.</p><p style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0in 0in 12pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">We understand that you have a lot of options when it comes to legal representation, we think we set ourselves apart from many other law firms in three distinct ways. First, we are completely focused on solving your problems and getting results. Sometimes that means going into court, but very often it means avoiding litigation and securing your desired result through other tools and strategies. We provide creative, and often counter-intuitive thinking to help solve your problems. Second, we listen to our clients and we respond quickly. We know how infuriating it can be when professionals of any sort do not really hear what clients are saying, or when firms are slow to respond. And third, we are not fans of the hourly-billing model. Instead, our job is to help you efficiently achieve the positive results you seek and deliver creative fee arrangements to that end.</p><p style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0in 0in 12pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">To find out more about how Pollock Cohen LLP can best help you address your issues and move forward with confidence, please contact our law office to schedule a free and confidential initial consultation.</p></span>"
