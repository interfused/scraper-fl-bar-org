    "description": "<p>Many law offices promote themselves as being <em>full-service</em> firms. But what does that actually mean? Broadly defined, it tells clients that the firm can handle a wide array of legal issues. At Leisawitz Heller in Wyomissing, a mid-sized firm that serves businesses and individuals throughout southeastern Pennsylvania, we put the service back in full service.</p><p>Our firm is divided into five main practice groups:</p><ul><li>Personal injury</li><li>Business law</li><li>Estate and trusts</li><li>Employment law</li><li>Commercial litigation</li></ul><p>While it's true this allows us to handle a variety of legal issues, when we refer to ourselves as a full-service law firm, we are not focused on the size and scope of our firm. Rather, we are referring to our commitment to understand our clients' needs and meeting those needs completely. When we say \"full service,\" we are reinforcing our promise to thoroughly analyze your legal issue, to develop a personalized strategy that addresses the unique aspects of your case, and to communicate effectively with you from the initial consultation through the resolution of your case &nbsp;— and to do all of that cost-effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Our firm's roots go back more than five decades, when founding shareholder Alan I. Baskin opened his practice in downtown Reading. We have served businesses and individuals in Berks County and beyond ever since. Each of our attorneys concentrates his or her practice in only a few areas. In an era in which commoditization and cookie-cutter approaches permeate even the legal world, our attorneys, paralegals and other support staff invest the time necessary to understand each client's situation. We take great pride in our ability to provide effective solutions in a friendly environment.</p><p>Our focus on client needs extends to our fee structures. We monitor costs closely, offer flat fees for many of our services, and work closely with every client to ensure that legal costs are manageable. Value is never in question when working with the lawyers at Leisawitz Heller.</p>"
