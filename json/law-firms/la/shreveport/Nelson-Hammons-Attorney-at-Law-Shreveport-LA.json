    "description": "<p>Nelson &amp; Hammons is a medical malpractice law firm dedicated to obtaining fair compensation for their Shreveport, Louisiana, clients who have suffered injuries due to negligence by doctors, nurses, hospitals and nursing homes. They have been championing the rights of victims of medical malpractice for over 30 years in North Louisiana, with a second office in Lafayette. The firm's attorneys emphasize a group approach that gives their clients the benefit of every attorney's particular area of knowledge and experience.</p><p>Meet The Founder</p><p>John L. Hammons earned his undergraduate degree from Northeast Louisiana University and his Juris Doctor from Louisiana State University. He formed the law firm of Nelson &amp; Hammons with Sydney B. Nelson in 1977. As his Super Lawyers profile states, practicing medical malpractice law has always been a ministry for Mr. Hammons, not just a job. He felt led to undertake the challenge of this complicated area of the law when first out of law school because he believed strongly that such clients deserve aggressive and compassionate legal representation. His early work led to the implementation of new postoperative monitoring standards in the Louisiana dental community.</p><p>Mr. Hammons has taken hundreds of medical malpractice cases in the past 40 years and believes that every one of them has been worth the challenge. He knows how difficult it can be to convince a jury that doctors and other health care professionals are at fault for substandard and unacceptable care because the media portrays the entire health care community as heroes, which they usually are.</p><p>All four attorneys at Nelson &amp; Hammons handle medical malpractice and related matters, making the law firm specially situated to thoroughly investigate and effectively handle such cases. </p>"
