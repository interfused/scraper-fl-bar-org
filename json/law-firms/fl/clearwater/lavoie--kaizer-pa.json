    "description": "<p>Those in Clearwater, Florida, who sustain injuries because of another's negligence or disregard for their safety may wonder if a lawsuit is a viable solution. At LaVoie &amp; Kaizer, P.A., we offer free initial consultations where they can meet with one of our attorneys to determine whether they have a personal injury case. Our law firm has offices in Tampa and Clearwater as well as Orlando, and we offer virtual appointments.</p><p>People who entrust their care to a medical professional or nursing home staff have rights, and when those rights are violated, they may sustain serious or even fatal injuries. Birth injuries, missed diagnoses, surgical mistakes, prescription errors, brain injuries, infections and bedsores are just a few of the ways lives can be forever changed. Our law firm works to hold hospitals, physicians, pharmacists and others liable for the harm our clients suffer.</p><p>We fight for clients in cases involving admiralty and maritime law, construction accidents, aviation and mass transit accidents, motor vehicle accidents, premises liability matters, animal attacks, dangerous products, sexual abuse, and assault and battery. Our law firm also represents family members of those who died because of another's negligence.</p><p>Because legal fees on top of other financial pressures can add to the stress of an accident's aftermath, we only charge clients if we win their case. Our rates are lower than standard legal fees to aid our clients, and LaVoie &amp; Kaizer, P.A., accepts credit cards.</p>"
