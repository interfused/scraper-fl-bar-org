    "description": "<p>The Law Office of David L. Hudgins in Roswell, Georgia, focuses largely on workers' compensation law and on protecting the rights of injured workers across the county. When a work accident leaves a person injured and unable to work, workers' compensation insurance should cover medical expenses, lost wages and other damages. Unfortunately, greedy insurers and strict policies often make it difficult for victims to exercise their rights and recoup the money they need to recover in comfort. I am well-versed in workers' compensation law and am intimately familiar with the claims process. I use my knowledge and experience to guide clients from the free initial consultation through the discovery and negotiations processes, and toward a favorable outcome.</p><p>I founded my law office to defend the rights of the injured. In addition to workers' compensation claims, I handle personal injury cases, medical malpractice claims and wrongful death lawsuits. Types of wrongdoings for which I routinely seek justice are as follows:</p><ul><li>Car accidents</li><li>Trucking accidents</li><li>Premises liability</li><li>Products liability</li><li>Brain injuries</li><li>Birth injuries</li><li>Nursing home abuse</li><li>Aviation and mass transit accidents</li><li>Animal bites</li><li>Sexual abuse</li><li>Bad-faith insurance</li></ul><p>The Law Office of David L. Hudgins becomes personally invested in each case it takes on. I strive to establish trusting attorney-client relationships through in-person and virtual appointments, and by going above and beyond to help injured parties and their families work toward a brighter future. I represent clients on a contingency fee basis, which means I do not charge clients unless I can recover for them a fair and just award.</p>"
