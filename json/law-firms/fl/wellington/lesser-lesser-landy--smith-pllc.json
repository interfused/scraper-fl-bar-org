    "description": "<p>Our Wellington team at Lesser, Lesser, Landy &amp; Smith, PLLC, brings 300 combined years of experience to every Florida personal injury case we take on. While this certainly does not guarantee that we win every case, it increases the odds.</p><p><strong>Cases handled by our law firm</strong></p><p>Over the past 90 years of serving Floridians, we have won millions of dollars in compensation for our clients. Most of these winnings have come from car crashes and wrongful death cases, but these are by no means the only ones we handle. Here are some additional areas of experience at our law firm:</p><blockquote style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px\"><p>• Medical malpractice<br>• Sexual abuse<br>• Nursing home abuse<br>• Construction accidents<br>• Trucking accidents<br>• Workers' compensation</p></blockquote><p><strong>Why choose Lesser, Lesser, Landy &amp; Smith, PLLC</strong></p><p>Our law firm is committed to helping our clients get the compensation amount their cases deserve. Insurance companies and other responsible parties often low-ball our clients in hopes that they will take the offer out of desperation. We determine the true worth of the case and keep pushing for our clients to get this and more.</p><p>Our attorneys believe clients should never pay to hear their basic rights or pay upfront to defend them. Consequently, we do not charge for case reviews or initial consultations. In fact, if we don't win your case, you never pay us a dime.</p>"
