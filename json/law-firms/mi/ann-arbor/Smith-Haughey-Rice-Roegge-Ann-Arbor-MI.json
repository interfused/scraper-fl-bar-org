    "description": "<p>Smith Haughey opened our Ann Arbor office on North Main Street in 2002. The firm had been looking to expand to the eastside of the state for some time and was delighted when Ed Stein chose to join the firm and head up that office. In 2005, we moved to the newly renovated Schwaben Building. The four-story, 22,000-square-foot building has been a fixture on Ashley Street since 1915.
