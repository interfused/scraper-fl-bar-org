    "description": "<p> Known for returning large-sum awards for victims of personal injury, Munley Law in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, has locations in Scranton, Stroudsburg and Carbondale as well. We use innovative strategies and new technology to demonstrate how our clients suffered harm from a car accident, dog bite or medical mistake. This approach has proven successful for our law firm, where our results include the following: </p><p> · Securing a settlement of $32.25 million following an airplane crash </p><p> · Obtaining a $17.5 million verdict in a wrongful death case </p><p> · Recovering $7.5 million when a child suffered an injury in an accident </p><p> Though millions of dollars may not undo the damage that has been caused, it certainly helps our clients on the road to recovery. Compensation such as this means the people we serve are able to pay medical bills, cover the cost of rehabilitation and replace missed wages. </p><p> The attorneys at our law firm know how to illustrate every loss our clients have experienced, including the emotional strain these events create. We have seen what occurs when someone loses a loved one. On top of the utter devastation our clients feel, many are left wondering how they will provide for their families. Our team is motivated to help those people overcome tragedy. </p><p> When people come to our law firm, they are met with the guidance of a team who truly cares. We lend a compassionate ear as they share their stories. To accommodate our clients, Munley Law accepts credit cards and offers free initial consultations. </p>"
