    "description": "<p>For more than 30 years, Kelly &amp; West Attorneys. P.A., has helped people in Raleigh, North Carolina, approach their legal challenges with confidence. Our law office offers defense for traffic tickets and misdemeanor DWI allegations. We understand that a criminal charge can follow people around for years, hindering their livelihood and ability to find employment. That is why we work tirelessly to reduce allegations or have them dropped altogether. We are undaunted by prosecutors and do everything in our power to avoid license revocation for clients.</p><p>In addition to skilled defense, our law office offers counsel for families. Our elder law attorneys work to draft wills, powers of attorney and health directives that protect aging people. We have a thorough knowledge of estate planning and administration best practices, ensuring family assets are distributed as intended. Although we provide focused representation for probate matters, we also deliver general real estate advice. Our attorneys have successfully helped buyers and sellers make transactions and secure closings.&nbsp;</p><p>At Kelly &amp; West Attorneys. P.A., we regularly advocate for victims of accidents and birth injuries. We help clients pursue the compensation they need to recover from car and truck collisions, slip and falls, dog bites, nursing home abuse and medical malpractice. Beyond handling general personal injury cases, we advocate for hurt workers. No matter what circumstances prospective clients face in Raleigh or Lillington, North Carolina, we invite them to join us at our law office for a free initial consultation.
