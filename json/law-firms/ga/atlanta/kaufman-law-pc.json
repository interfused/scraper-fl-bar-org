    "description": "<p>Suffering a personal injury is devastating, but it should not be financially crippling. At Kaufman Law, P.C., in Atlanta, Georgia, we have a longstanding history of recovering compensation on behalf of victims of negligence across the state. In a medical malpractice case, we secured $25 million for a client whose doctor failed to diagnose a stroke in a timely manner. Following a car accident, the team at our law firm obtained more than $1.9 million for a woman who suffered serious injuries. Established more than 40 years ago, we know our community and the challenges people here face following an accident.</p><p>Obtaining millions of dollars for the injured — whether through workers’ compensation or a personal injury lawsuit — is part of the reason the attorneys at our law firm hold honors such as an Avvo “Superb” rating; being listed in The National Trial Lawyers: Top 100; and receiving the ratings of AV Preeminent* and Martindale-Hubbell Distinguished* from Martindale-Hubbell. However, these accolades pale in comparison to the satisfaction we have helping people get back on their feet.</p><p>Our mission at Kaufman Law, P.C., is to deliver exceptional results and outstanding customer service. The attorneys at our law firm offer bilingual services, free initial consultations and even visit with clients in their home or at the hospital. We make ourselves available around the clock to answer questions and alleviate concerns. To best accommodate our clients, we accept credit cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"smallText\">* AV®, AV Preeminent®, Martindale-Hubbell Distinguished and Martindale-Hubbell Notable are certification marks used under license in accordance with the Martindale-Hubbell certification procedures, standards and policies. Martindale-Hubbell® is the facilitator of a peer review rating process. Ratings reflect the anonymous opinions of members of the bar and the judiciary. Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Rating™ fall into two categories – legal ability and general ethical standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
