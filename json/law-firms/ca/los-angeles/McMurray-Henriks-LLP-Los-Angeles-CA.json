    "description": "<p>McMurray Henriks, LLP provides award-winning representation in Los Angeles, California. Our law firm has been built on the foundation of attorneys who received national acclaim in their respective fields. Since the 1990s, our law firm has changed its name several times, but it has never changed its focus on defending the rights of our clients.</p><p>Our law firm now handles cases heavily focused on police brutality, the use of excessive force and unnecessary shootings. This has caused us to tackle several high-profile cases in California, where clients might not have otherwise had the opportunity to obtain justice for their sufferings or the loved ones who did not survive.</p><p>Over the years, these are some of the landmark settlements McMurray Henriks, LLP has successfully recovered in these and other areas:</p><p>• $22 million for a wrongful death case kept confidential<br>• $7.7 million for a police pursuit case, which is the largest single winning against the LAPD<br>• $7.6 million for a personal injury caused by a Los Angeles City-owned tree<br>• $4.65 for a police excessive force lawsuit</p><p>We are confident that our reputation and case results speak volumes, but we also feel good representation involves more than just winning. We have stood by families' sides through some of the most difficult moments in their lives and offer our sincere compassion and empathy. This motivates us all the more to seek justice on their behalf.</p>"
