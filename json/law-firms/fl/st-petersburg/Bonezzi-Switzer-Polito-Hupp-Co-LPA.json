    "description": "<p>The Cleveland law firm of Bonezzi Switzer Murphy Polito &amp; Hupp Co. L.P.A. is recognized as one of the leading civil defense trial law firms in Ohio. Our law firm offers a wealth of experience in the defense of medical malpractice, nursing home malpractice, workers' compensation and toxic tort claims. We also maintain thriving appellate and family law practices.</p><p>Few law firms can match our experience managing complex litigation from beginning to end. Collectively, our lawyers have tried more than 900 cases to verdict in state and federal courts. In the overwhelming majority of these cases, we obtained defense verdicts. Our lawyers understand that cases are very often won or lost before a case goes to the jury. As a result, we will tirelessly investigate every factual and legal aspect of your case. We have access to a multitude of renowned experts. The testimony of these individuals before and during trial regularly proves invaluable to our clients.</p><p>When BSMPH was founded in January 1998, our firm consisted of eight attorneys. Through our commitment to recruiting and retaining exceptional litigators in a variety of practice areas, today our law firm is comprised of 20 lawyers. Our attorneys have earned a number of professional accolades. For instance, half of our lawyers have been selected for inclusion in Ohio Super Lawyers. Contact our law firm to schedule an initial consultation.</p>"
