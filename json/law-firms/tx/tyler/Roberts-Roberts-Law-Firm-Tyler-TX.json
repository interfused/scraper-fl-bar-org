    "description": "<p><strong>Helping Injured East Texans for Over 35 Years</strong></p><p>Roberts &amp; Roberts is an East Texas law firm with a history of helping injured people. The firm originally consisted of two brothers, Randell (Randy) C. Roberts and Bruce L. Roberts, who were raised in Tyler, Texas. Roberts &amp; Roberts now consists of seven attorneys who represent injured East Texans. The firm focuses on personal injury law, including auto accidents, truck accidents, defective products, workplace accidents, oilfield accidents, defective medications and medical devices, and more.</p><p><strong>Nationally Recognized</strong></p><p>Our dedication to making a difference in our clients' lives has brought us into the national spotlight several times. Shortly after the law firm was established, it received local recognition for obtaining the county’s largest wrongful death settlement at that time. The law firm subsequently received national recognition for its work in uncovering the Firestone documents that helped lead to the recall of the Firestone ATX and Wilderness lines of tires. The firm continues to draw national media attention because of its role in important product liability cases.</p><p><strong>Board Certified, Top-Rated Lawyers</strong></p><p>All lawyers must be licensed to practice law, but only three percent (3%) are Board Certified in Personal Injury Trial Law or Civil Trial Law. Roberts &amp; Roberts has four attorneys that are Board Certificated in Personal Injury Trial Law. A Board Certified attorney is a lawyer who has demonstrated special competence in a particular field and whose competence is certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization. Among other recognitions, Roberts &amp; Roberts also holds the highest rating (“AV”) from the Martindale-Hubbell Attorney Rating Service and is included in its Bar Register of Preeminent Lawyers. </p><p><strong>Unmatched Support for Our Clients</strong></p><p>Delivering unmatched support during your difficult time, we will help ensure that you receive the medical care you need as well as work with your creditors until you get back on your feet. If your injury prevents you from coming to our office, we will meet you at your home or at the hospital, and we will remain accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week to address your questions and concerns and offer peace of mind about your situation.</p><p><strong>Free Case Evaluations and No Fees Unless We Win</strong></p><p>At Roberts &amp; Roberts, we never want legal costs to prevent injured people from getting the justice they deserve. The vast majority of our clients with personal injury and wrongful death cases hire us on a contingency-fee basis. One of the main benefits of a contingency fee is that you, our client, don’t have to pay us anything until we recover compensation for you. If you are not compensated, you will not owe anything for attorney’s fees, court costs, or other legal expenses.</p>"
