    "description": "<p>Sidkoff Pincus &amp; Green (“SPG”), provides individuals and businesses with a diverse range of legal needs. Founded in 1958, SPG is one of the oldest law firms in Philadelphia. We like to think that our longevity is a testament to the quality of our lawyers' passion, skills and results.</p><p>The focus of our law firm is a direct product of the type of work our clients bring to us. Over the years, due to the good fortune of serving thousands of clients in almost every type of matter, our attorneys have developed a broad base of legal experience. Recently, we have seen a heavy concentration on business and employment litigation, mixed with contract negotiations and the drafting of transactional documents. We routinely represent clients in claims involving contract issues, shareholder disputes, wrongful termination and whistleblower matters, intellectual property disputes, and select personal injury cases.</p><p>At Sidkoff Pincus &amp; Green, we strive to provide high quality, innovative and aggressive services, performed in a cost-effective, efficient manner. Moreover, we make every effort to understand more than just the law. We work hard to learn enough about our clients' businesses to ensure that the legal advice we offer and the strategies we deploy fit their unique needs. We know that our clients rely on us to be their advocates and advisers, and therefore we recognize that we must act as fiduciaries with a solemn responsibility to always be prepared.</p><p>Contact us to discuss your legal matter. Initial consultations are free.</p>"
