    "description": "<p>Motor vehicle accidents are not always severe but when they are, they can be physically, emotionally and financially devastating. Anastopoulo Law Firm in Wilmington, North Carolina, represents victims of all types of roadway collisions, including car accidents, trucking accidents, motorcycle accidents and bicycle accidents. Our team sees injured parties through all aspects of a personal injury claim, from the initial investigation through negotiations and, if necessary, to trial. Our ultimate goal is to hold at-fault parties accountable and seek justice in the form of monetary recovery.</p><p>With a passion for justice and a firm belief that innocent parties should not have to pay for the negligence of others, our law firm deploys the breadth of its resources to protecting victims' rights. We believe that one of the best ways to do this is by helping them recover the maximum amount of compensation for their injuries. This is the case regardless of what type of event led to their harm. Examples of types of cases we take on include the following:</p><ul><li>Medical malpractice</li><li>Birth injury</li><li>Brain injury</li><li>Premises liability</li><li>Products liability</li><li>Animal bites</li><li>Trucking accidents</li><li>Workers' compensation</li><li>Wrongful death </li></ul><p>Anastopoulo Law Firm has a long track record of success in both North Carolina and South Carolina. Our results include several million- and multimillion-dollar jury verdicts and settlements, many of which made local and national headlines.</p><p>With over 25 years of experience, founding attorney Akim Anastopoulo knows what it takes to establish successful attorney-client relationships. He or another attorney at our office begins each case with a free initial consultation. We make home and hospital visits, and we never require payment unless clients win.</p>"
