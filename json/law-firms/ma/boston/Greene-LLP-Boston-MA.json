    "description": "<p><strong>Greene LLP, Boston \"Whistleblower\" Lawyers</strong></p><p>Located on Liberty Square in Boston's financial district, the lawyers at Greene LLP have been pursuing cases under the False Claims Act for more than 20 years. This Massachusetts-based law firm takes on \"whistleblower\" cases nationwide. </p><p>Also known as \"qui tam\" cases, whistleblower cases usually involve an individual who sues a company for fraudulent behavior on behalf of the U. S. or a state government. Whistleblowers may receive up to 30 percent of the monies recovered by the government.</p><p>Our law firm has more than two decades of false claims litigation experience. Our lead attorney, Thomas Greene, testified before Congress at a 2013 committee hearing on the False Claims Act.</p><p>Our team of five attorneys has successfully sued large pharmaceutical companies, recovering more than $700 million on behalf of the U. S. government. They have represented whistleblowers in several industries, including health care, postal, import, utilities and defense. Greene LLP even accepts cases the government declines to pursue. We also handle cases that have been denied.</p><p>Our hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time. We offer free initial consultations. We work on a contingency basis, which means we get paid only if we win.</p>"
