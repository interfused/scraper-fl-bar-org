    "description": "<p>Certa Farrish Law Group serves the Seattle area from our office in Edmonds, Washington. Our practice works in personal injury case management and representation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At our law firm, we handle a wide variety of cases. Most involve serious injuries. Our services include assistance with every stage of the process, such as investigation, negotiation and trial litigation.</p><h2>Talking With Insurance Companies</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Insurance companies routinely deny valid claims. They also typically make relatively low offers to begin the negotiations process.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We work with our clients to uncover the reasons behind denials, make necessary appeals directly to insurance companies and negotiate tenaciously to pursue maximum compensation. Through it all, our priority is effective communication with both our clients and the other parties in the discussion.</p><h2>Handling Complex, Serious Cases</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We practice in many areas of personal injury law. Whenever an accident is serious enough to change someone's future, we are there to provide professional, high-quality representation. Example practice areas at our law firm are car, public bus, bicycle, motorcycle, pedestrian and commercial-vehicle accidents; construction site accidents; slips and falls in grocery stores, public places and other easily accessible locations; animal bites and wrongful death.</p><h2>Analyzing Specific Situations</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Certa Farrish Law Group is currently accepting new clients. Our law firm offers free, zero-obligation initial consultations. During these meetings, we work to understand the situation and provide initial strategies. Virtual appointments are also available.</p>"
