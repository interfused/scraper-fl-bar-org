    "description": "<p>Tinsman &amp; Sciano, Inc. is located in San Antonio, Texas. I, Jeffrey Anderson, and my law firm have helped clients throughout Texas with all types of personal injury and wrongful death cases and claims. I have been practicing law for more than 35 years, and I am eager and driven to win my clients’ cases. If you or a loved one have suffered a personal injury, including medical malpractice, you need an attorney who will strongly advocate to protect your rights.</p><p>At Tinsman &amp; Sciano, Inc., we represent people who have serious personal injuries from such causes as accidents or the negligence or misconduct of medical personnel. The goal of my representation is to obtain the treatment, care, and compensation that you deserve.</p><p>I represent injured veterans, military members and military dependents. The major practice focus of my law firm is on military medical malpractice. I handle claims such as failure to diagnose, birth injuries, federal tort claims, serious car and truck accidents and motorcycle wrecks. As a former trainer of medics at Fort Sam, Houston, I can quickly identify issues in a case and present them effectively.</p><p>As a military officer, I have a great deal of experience handling government cases, and I receive many referrals from other lawyers because of my extensive knowledge of military medical malpractice. My familiarity with government officials and attorneys on the other side who work with the Department of Justice benefits my clients considerably.</p><p>Our law firm offers a free initial case consultation. Know that we do not get paid until you get paid.</p>"
