    "description": " Solely devoted to personal injury, I am attorney Stephen R. Marshall, and my practice, Marshall Law, P.C., takes cases in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and across the state. My law firm has a proven track record of helping people get back on their feet following incidents that include the following:<p>• Medical malpractice <br>• Car accidents<br>• Catastrophic injuries</p><p>Since opening my law firm, I have put millions of dollars back into the hands of people who have suffered the unthinkable. I am a skilled litigator who fights for every penny so my clients can afford medical care, restore losses and move forward with their lives. My hope is to reach a settlement without having to go to court, though I prepare for each case as though it will end up in trial. This comprehensive approach is why I have held countless defendants accountable for my clients' damages.</p><p>As a result of my work, I have been selected for inclusion in New Mexico Super Lawyers and have been listed in The National Trial Lawyers: Top 40 under 40. I am also known for my compassion as people navigate some of the toughest moments of their lives. Marshall Law, P.C., offers virtual appointments over the phone or using other technology. My law firm also provides prospective clients with free initial consultations.</p>"
