    "description": "<p>From our office in Tyler, Texas, Vickery Law Firm represents clients throughout the region in a wide variety of personal injury, civil litigation and mediation matters.</p><p>With nearly 25 years of experience, our founding attorney, Ron Vickery, is uniquely qualified to help injury victims seek justice in complex personal injury claims. Before opening his own plaintiffs personal injury practice, he spent 15 years working with an insurance defense law firm where he stood on the other side of personal injury cases.

He understands the tactics they use, and he knows the right approach to seeking fair compensation for the losses injury victims have suffered.</p><p>Our law firm's mediation practice is focused on helping people resolve their disputes without the need for litigation.&nbsp;In his capacity as a mediator, Mr. Vickery does not represent either party to the dispute. His only concern is to help the parties work through their differences and reach a solution that all concerned parties can support.</p><p>Contact Vickery Law Firm to discuss your personal injury or mediation needs.
