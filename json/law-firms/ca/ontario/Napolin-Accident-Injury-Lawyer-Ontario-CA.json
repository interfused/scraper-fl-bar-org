    "description": "<p><strong>Napolin Accident Injury Lawyer</strong></p><p>Have you experienced an injury in an automobile accident or at work? Or are you dealing with the death of a loved one because of an accident caused by a careless driver or product? You should consult with a strong and compassionate legal team like ours for serious accidents and injuries. Napolin Accident Injury Lawyer has extensive experience with personal injury, work injury and auto accident injury insurance claims. If you are looking for guidance after an injury, call 1-844-984-4878 to learn if you qualify for a free initial consultation with Alexander D. Napolin, Esq.</p><p>Napolin has four Southern California office locations to serve the residents of Southern California. Therefore, in person office access is provided to residents of San Bernardino County, Riverside County, Los Angeles County, Orange County and Inland Empire.</p><p><strong>Injury Lawyer Offering Contingency Fee Billing to Southern California Residents</strong></p><p>Napolin offers its services for no money up front. In exchange for representation, the client agrees to pay on a contingency. This means that the client only pays when and if the case successfully pays out money. The downside risk (the risk that the case will not be successful) is borne by our law office. And that goes for case hard costs as well. This is representation to the client on a true contingency fee basis. In other words, unless Napolin recovers money for you, you do not owe us anything even if Napolin has advanced costs.</p><p><strong>Auto Accident Law Claims, Cases and Lawsuits</strong></p><p>The insurance adjuster and insurance attorneys are not your friends. Their sole goal in their career is to pay out as little on your claim, regardless of how seriously injured you may be. When you retain our firm, you gain strong advocacy inside and outside of the courtroom to combat the injustice that the adjuster is trained to perpetrate on you. We do not let our clients who have sustained bodily injury in a car crash, truck accident, automobile collision, pedestrian accident or other accident that happens upon the roadways of Southern California!</p><p><strong>Workers' Compensation/Work Injury Representation</strong></p><p>The workers' compensation system is a complicated system to successfully navigate. Workers' compensation insurance is supposed to provide benefits to employees who suffer work-related injury or illness. Unfortunately, adjusters use injured worker ignorance to take advantage of them, leaving injured workers without need financial and medical benefits to get their life back on track. Our law firm can help you determine if an accident during work hours, or an illness contracted years after your job ended, is eligible for benefits. Then, we'll walk you through the application process, and appeal on your behalf to make sure you receive every advantage against the adjuster in the claims process. If trial is necessary, we go there for you!</p><p>Napolin Accident Injury Lawyer<strong>:</strong> Helping victims of accident injury in Upland, Claremont, Pomona, La Verne, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, San Dimas, Chino, Chino Hills, Diamond Bar, Walnut, Glendora, Covina, West Covina, La Puente, Baldwin Park, Brea, Fontana, Colton, Corona, Rialto, Redlands, San Bernardino and Montclair CA.
