    "description": "<p>At the law office of L. Hugh Kemp, we are aware of just how frightening it can be to suffer a personal injury, especially if the victim is unable to work due to his or her injuries. Indeed, anxiety can often grow as medical bills begin to pile up. In circumstances such as these, victims need to seek the counsel of an attorney who will fight aggressively on their behalf.</p><p>Regardless of whether an individual's legal claim relates to a motor vehicle collision, a slip-and-fall accident, a defective product, medical malpractice or the wrongful death of a loved one, we can help provide knowledgeable guidance. However, it is important to mention that we can also assist clients with a wide array of other legal concerns, including employment troubles, creditor and debtor problems and misdemeanor criminal defense. With our office located in Dalton, Georgia, we are able to aid clients throughout Whitfield County as well as neighboring counties.</p><p>Often times, it is impossible for a person to anticipate when legal issues will arise, but when they do, know that we are here to make sure the individual gets the expert assistance he or she deserves. It is important to work with an attorney who has the experience and know-how to help make the law work for you.</p>"
