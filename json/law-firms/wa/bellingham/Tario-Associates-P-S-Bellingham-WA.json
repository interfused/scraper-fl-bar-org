    "description": "<p>Tario &amp; Associates, P.S., handles personal injury cases in Bellingham, Washington, and throughout Whatcom County, Skagit, Snohomish and Island Counties. Our law office is built on a commitment to practical advice, tenacious advocacy and client-focused legal services.</p><p>We have been representing personal injury clients for over four decades. Our most common cases involve victims of motor-vehicle accidents, medical malpractice, traumatic brain injuries, wrongful death, sexual assault, nursing home abuse, and maritime injuries.</p><p><strong>We set realistic goals</strong></p><p>One of the core elements of our success is setting reasonable expectations. Most insurance companies offer clients extremely low opening offers so we let them know what a reasonable and realistic settlement offer should be.</p><p>With our team on your side, you are likely to get a settlement five to twenty times higher than you could negotiate on your own. We are repaid from a percentage of your settlement so no fees are ever collected up front or at all if we do not reach a settlement on your behalf.</p><p><strong>We pursue our beliefs</strong></p><p>Because we do not overreach, we are ready to stand by our clients until we get the outcome we know they deserve. At our law office, we stand up to the most stubborn and most powerful adversaries; providing professional, fearless representation.</p><p><strong>We keep information flowing</strong></p><p>Another aspect of our success is communication. We understand that injured people - or those who have lost loved ones - want to know that progress is happening. We provide updates, discuss revised strategies and proactively communicate on important topics.</p><p><strong>We make representation accessible</strong></p><p>At Tario &amp; Associates, P.S., our first commitment is to our clients. Our law office offers free consultations, credit-card payment options and virtual appointments.</p><p>We advocate for injury victims and their families. Do not hesitate to reach out to us if you or a loved one was injured because of the negligence of another. </p>"
