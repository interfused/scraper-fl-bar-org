    "description": "<p>After an injury accident, we at Anesi, Ozmon, Rodin, Novak &amp; Kohen Ltd. in Chicago, Illinois, believe that justice for the victim involves the maximum amount of compensation the law allows. Our attorneys are fully invested in seeking the best results possible for our clients. Our law firm is the recognized leader in the field of construction accident litigation, and we have a long track record of courtroom success. </p><p>On-the-job injuries are typically different from other injury cases because the workers' compensation system rarely evaluates who was at fault for the accident. However, in the construction industry, accidents often occur because of a third party's negligence. In these cases, the injured worker may be able to file a third-party liability lawsuit to optimize the recovery of compensation. </p><p>While other law firms may be quick to settle, we approach every injury case as if it will go to trial. Thus, when litigation is warranted, we are already prepared. Our attorneys are tenacious and aggressive advocates, fighting hard on behalf of our clients. We have obtained a number of record verdicts and multimillion-dollar recoveries for our clients. We often take on difficult cases that other firms turn down. When we say clients have a case, they can feel confident in the strength of their claim. </p><p>Favorable verdicts, high-dollar awards, record recoveries - these are strong measures of success. But, what truly sets our law firm apart is the number of referrals we receive from the people who know the system best: insurance adjusters, judges, arbitrators and even opposing counsel. When someone they care about is injured, they refer them to us.<br>That is the kind of reputation earned over many years and many courtroom successes. </p><p>Anesi, Ozmon, Rodin, Novak &amp; Kohen Ltd. represents clients throughout the state of Illinois, including those living in Chicago, Joliet, Rockford, Aurora, Peoria, Kankakee, Rock Island, Wheaton, Champaign-Urbana, Ottawa and Springfield.
