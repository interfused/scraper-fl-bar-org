    "description": "<p>Whether caused by a reckless driver or a premises liability issue, a personal injury or wrongful death creates far-reaching consequences for families in Sharon, Pennsylvania. At Gervelis Law Firm, we help victims find answers and seek compensation while focusing on physical recovery. From our office, we take cases in the cities of Warren, Youngstown, East Liverpool, Akron and Columbiana. We also work in greater Summit, Portage, Columbiana, Trumbull and Mahoning counties.</p><p>For over 15 years, Gervelis Law Firm has focused exclusively on representing people hurt in accidents as well as their families. While we are capable of resolving many kinds of cases, the ones we handle regularly involve car, truck and motorcycle accidents. We do our own research to determine the cause of a crash. We also examine the severity and complexity of injuries sustained to seek the appropriate compensation for lost income and hospital bills.</p><p>Beyond intervening in vehicular collisions, Gervelis Law Firm calls out medical malpractice when we see it. If a client is hurt as the result of a defective drug, medical device or simply an apathetic doctor, we identify and hold the negligent provider accountable. Our attorneys are not afraid of squaring off with high-profile medical insurance companies and work tirelessly to pursue justice. In many cases, we are able to negotiate a settlement outside of the intense courtroom setting.</p><p>We welcome prospective clients to join us for a free initial consultation regardless of whether their injuries happened on the job or on the road. For your convenience, we accept credit cards.</p>"
