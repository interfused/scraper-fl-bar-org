    "description": "<p>Experienced attorney Jonathan D'Agostino founded our law firm, D'Agostino &amp; Associates, P.C., in 1990. In the nearly 25 years since our firm's doors first opened, we have represented hundreds of clients from New York and New Jersey who suffered injuries at the hands of negligent individuals and businesses. Today, we continue to serve victims in the area from our six different office locations, including the one in Freehold.</p><p>At our law firm, we primarily represent injured clients in personal injury cases. However, we also regularly assist clients who need assistance filing for Social Security Disability benefits or those who have had the benefits to which they believe to be entitled denied. In addition, we also defend those who face criminal charges in New York or New Jersey.</p><p>If you have a need in one of our law firm's practice areas, you can count on our attorneys to provide exceptional service individually tailored to fit your needs. Even though D'Agostino &amp; Associates, P.C., is a large firm with eight attorneys, we pride ourselves on operating with a small-firm mentality, resulting in our clients receiving the personalized attention they deserve, regardless of their needs. If you would like to learn more about our law firm, you can take advantage of our free initial consultation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
