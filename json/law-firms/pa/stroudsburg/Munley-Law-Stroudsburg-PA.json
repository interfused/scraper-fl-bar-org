    "description": "<p> At Munley Law in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, we truly know what it means to work with someone during one of the most difficult times of his or her life. Suffering a personal injury means much more than physical harm. It creates doubt and frustration. It leaves a gaping emotional hole. It leads to financial losses that, without an effective lawsuit, could take a lifetime to recover. Fortunately, the team at our law firm knows how to handle these matters with compassion and integrity. We offer free initial consultations and accept credit cards to accommodate our clients. </p><p> Our attorneys have a proven track record of returning million-dollar awards for people who have encountered all types of injury. Medical malpractice, motor vehicle accidents, premises liability and defective products, for example, require the knowledge and experience of a team like the one at our law firm. For more than 50 years, we have been advocating for victims of negligence in communities such as Wilkes-Barre, Scranton and Carbondale. </p><p> In addition to seven- and eight-figure verdicts and settlements, our attorneys are also known for the following: </p><p> · Being selected for inclusion in Super Lawyers list </p><p> · Receiving membership in the Million Dollar Advocates Forum </p><p> · Getting listed in The National Trial Lawyers: Top 100 </p><p> · Being selected for inclusion in The Best Lawyers in America </p><p> Munley Law is, above all else, a place where people are able to find guidance and reassurance. Our law firm prioritizes compassion. We never view a case as simply something that happened to someone who walked through our door. Instead, we welcome clients into our family and treat them like we would treat one of our own. </p>"
