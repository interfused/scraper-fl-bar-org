    "description": "<p>At Bland Richter, LLP, we mainly prosecute legal malpractice cases along with complex commercial and professional negligence cases. Our mission is to provide our clients with tenacious, single-minded, principled and timely representation with results that count. Our central philosophy is simple - we fight hard for our clients and we fight within the rules. We believe in being honest and providing candor to the Court and recognize that we cannot effectively represent any client if we do not maintain credibility and integrity in the eyes of the court. Our hard-charging style may occasionally offend the opposition, but we rarely receive complaints from our clients. An attorney for an adverse party once described litigating against Bland Richter as like \"being in Fallujah every day at the start of the Iraq war.\" The bottom line is: We fight hard for our clients, very hard, but always between the lines.</p><p>Partners Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter successfully completed national testing in Legal Malpractice and have received certification as diplomats in the field of <strong>Legal Malpractice</strong> by the American Board of Professional Liability Attorneys.<span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #646464; line-height: 150%\">. They have a combined 45 years of experience and have tried or arbitrated numerous cases. With offices in both Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina, the firm serves the entire State of South Carolina and beyond. In addition to its members being admitted to practice law in South Carolina, Mr. Bland is also a member of the Pennsylvania and Florida bars. Bland Richter is available for association anywhere in the Country where its services may be necessary. Both Mr. Bland and Mr. Richter are members of the Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum. This organization has as its members some of the top trial lawyers in America and only admits attorneys who have obtained multiple verdicts or settlements for their clients which exceed $2,000,000.00. Their listings can be found at Multi-Million Dollar Advocates.</span></p><p>We welcome referrals from other attorneys and are always willing to include referral attorneys in any fee structure agreed to by the client and consistent with the rules of professional conduct.</p>"
