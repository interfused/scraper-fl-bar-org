    "description": "<p>Having taken hundreds of personal injury cases to trial, Charles Boyk Law Offices, LLC, is synonymous with success. From our Bowling Green, Ohio, office and four other locations, we negotiate and litigate our way to significant awards for our clients, such as: </p><ul class=\"unIndentedList\"><li> A $1.25 million settlement following a truck accident</li><li> A $1.05 million settlement in a wrongful death case</li><li> A $950,000 settlement in a pedestrian accident that ended in permanent brain injuries</li></ul><p>Though the results speak for themselves, we pride ourselves on how our clients view our law offices. They know that when we say we will take care of everything, we truly take care of everything. Our clients need only to focus on recovery while we aggressively work toward maximum compensation. Essentially, we take care of our clients the way we would tend to our own family if they were in that position.</p><p>Our attorneys take insurance providers, medical practitioners and others to task. These entities often try to take advantage of the injured in their vulnerable state by offering low settlements or awards far below policy limits. We stand up for our clients to protect them against such actions. Charles Boyk Law Offices, LLC, offers free initial consultations and operates on a contingency fee basis. We hold honors that include an Avvo \"Superb\" rating.</p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal 0 false false false EN-US JA X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml></xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]><style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style><![endif]-->"
