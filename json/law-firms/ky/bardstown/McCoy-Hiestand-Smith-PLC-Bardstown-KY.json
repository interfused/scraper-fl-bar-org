    "description": "<p>A personal injury can happen in an instance, but its consequences can haunt you for a lifetime. At the law office of McCoy, Hiestand &amp; Smith, PLC, in Bardstown, Kentucky, we cannot undo the physical, emotional or financial ramifications of a personal injury. We can, however, lessen them. We use our extensive knowledge of the law, decades of experience and passion for justice to aggressively advocate for victims' rights and to hold at-fault parties accountable for their negligence. As highly experienced litigators, we do not settle simply because it is easier. Rather, we do whatever it takes to ensure you receive maximum compensation, even if that makes taking your case to court.</p><p>Our law office practices exclusively in the area of personal injury law. This narrowed focus enables us to devote the full scope of our resources toward protecting your rights in even the most complex of cases, such as the following:</p><blockquote style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px\"><p>• Bad faith insurance<br>• Aviation and mass transit accidents<br>• Class actions<br>• Medical malpractice<br>• Drugs and medical device injuries<br>• Birth injuries<br>• Brain injuries<br>• Construction accidents<br>• Civil rights suits<br>• Disability claims<br>• Products liability<br>• Wrongful death</p></blockquote><p>We also represent individuals who experience harm as a result of everyday accidents.
