    "description": "<p>A serious injury can be extremely painful and even life-changing. And sometimes, the insurance company you depend on for protection will do whatever's possible to limit their payout, leaving you with unpaid bills, lost wages and worrying about how to provide for your loved ones and your future. It is important to realize if someone else's carelessness has left you seriously injured in Rock Hill, South Carolina or nearby, you are entitled to fair and just compensation...</p>"
