    "description": "<p>Recovering from an injury or facing the loss of a loved one following a tragic accident is one of the most difficult things to go through in life. I, attorney Brett Osborne, have spent more than 28 years assisting accident victims, and I am proud to serve my neighbors and friends in Greenwood and across the state of Indiana in their times of need. </p><p>There is no predicting when an accident may occur. Another driver's negligent, reckless or intentional actions may bring devastation and loss from which there may seem no recovery. A birth injury, nursing home injury or another form of medical malpractice may result in years of struggle and pain. However, with the resources of my law firm, Brett Osborne, I am committed to bringing whatever relief is available through the civil courts to help victims and their families regain their lives. </p><p>My law firm also handles work-related injuries due to third-party liability. If your injury on the job resulted from someone other than your employer, such as defective equipment, a negligent subcontractor, a reckless driver or others, you may have a very complex case involving numerous other entities and individuals. I have successfully obtained compensation for injured workers, dealing with their employers, insurance companies and medical experts while the injured workers focus on getting well. </p><p>If you have suffered injuries or loss due to someone else's actions, contact me, Brett Osborne, at the law office of Brett Osborne in beautiful Greenwood. We offer free consultations, and we are happy to meet with you virtually if you are concerned about your health and safety.</p>"
