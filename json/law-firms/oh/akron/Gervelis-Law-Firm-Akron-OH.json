    "description": "<p>At Gervelis Law Firm, our attorneys provide honed representation for personal injury victims in Akron, Ohio, and the surrounding cities. Since our inception in 2000, we have worked solely to help clients recover from many different kinds of accidents, no matter how complex the scenario. Having seen through the eyes of injured people and their families for over 15 years, our seasoned attorneys are uniquely qualified to go to battle with insurance companies and seek the maximum possible compensation.</p><p>A car, truck or motorcycle accident leaves devastating consequences in its wake, especially when it results in a wrongful death. Even worse than the physical wounds and recovery time are the medical bills, lost wages and confrontations with cold insurance companies. Gervelis Law Firm intervenes not only in establishing liability with our own investigation but also in dealing with money-minded insurers. In fact, because we are well-known for being aggressive in the courtroom, insurance providers regularly back down and offer a settlement instead. The same is true when we are representing victims of medical malpractice, defective drugs, defective medical devices, premises liability and workplace accidents.</p><p>Although we are based in Akron, we welcome prospective clients in the cities of Youngstown, Warren, Columbiana and East Liverpool to meet with us in a free initial consultation. We also extend this service to people in the counties of Trumbull, Mahoning, Portage, Columbia and Summit. In an effort to streamline appointments, Gervelis Law Firm takes credit cards as an accepted form of payment.</p>"
