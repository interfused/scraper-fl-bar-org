    "description": "<p>At Michael P. Stacy Attorney at Law, I assist people who are seeking Social Security Disability Insurance and workers’ compensation benefits. From my law office in Rochester, New York, I offer personalized services to enable people from the metro area to understand their rights and develop appropriate legal strategies. To ensure that I can give appropriate attention to each client, I deliberately maintain a solo practice and accept only a small number of cases at a time.</p><p>Social Security Disability claims often have high denial rates, so appeals are necessary in many cases. I am committed to advising and advocating for my clients throughout this process. I have experience successfully appealing denied claims in federal district court, and I am prepared to take each case to this level if necessary to secure the optimal outcome for each client.</p><p>Securing workers’ compensation benefits for a traumatic injury, occupational disease or repetitive stress injury can be challenging in New York. Since I opened my law office in 1997, workers’ compensation has been one of my primary focuses, so I am familiar with the techniques insurance companies use to challenge a worker’s claim. I strive to help each client secure the maximum compensation available by carefully documenting the origin and severity of each injury. My law office also aids clients in making personal injury claims against negligent parties when appropriate.</p><p>At Michael P. Stacy Attorney at Law, I dedicate my practice to helping injury victims seek fair compensation for their medical expenses and other losses so they can move forward with confidence that their needs will be covered.</p>"
