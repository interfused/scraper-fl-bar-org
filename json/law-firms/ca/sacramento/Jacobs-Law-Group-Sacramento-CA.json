    "description": "<p>People injured in accidents caused by others’ negligence often have more questions than answers. In Sacramento, California, Jacobs Law Group provides legal remedies to the difficult circumstances clients bring to the law office. Attorney Jeffrey L. Jacobs has more than 30 years of experience representing clients in personal injury cases and seeking the compensation that is due to them.</p><p>Drunk drivers, fatigued truckers, the motorists who failed to look for motorcycles – they all have two things in common: They created harmful situations that were preventable and they were negligent in their duty to act safely. Other examples of negligent behavior include:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 21pt; text-indent: -18pt\" class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\"><!--[if !supportLists]--></p>• Designing, manufacturing or selling dangerous products<br>• Making medical mistakes or failing to diagnose a health condition<br>• Allowing floor or other surface conditions to become tripping or slipping hazards<br>• Neglecting to establish safety measures such as adequate lighting or security cameras in areas where people are vulnerable to attack<p></p><p>When individuals and entities injure someone, it is their responsibility to cover the damages. The goal of the legal team is to identify them all and fight for them at the negotiation table or in court. This includes economic losses such as medical bills and lost wages. Noneconomic damages may be losses with no clear price tags, such as lost quality of life, loss of consortium or loss of a family member.</p><p>Jacobs Law Group offers free initial consultations so people can visit the law office to determine if they have a case. Virtual appointments are available.</p>"
